CVE-2022-24761,1385513396,"CVE-2022-24761 Description: Waitress is a Web Server Gateway Interface server for Python 2 and 3. When using Waitress versions 2.1.0 and prior behind a proxy that does not properly validate the incoming HTTP request matches the RFC7230 standard, Waitress and the frontend proxy may disagree on where one request starts and where it ends. This would allow requests to be smuggled via the front-end proxy to waitress and later behavior. There are two classes of vulnerability that may lead to request smuggling that are addressed by this advisory: The use of Python's `int` to parse strings into integers, leading to ` 10` to be parsed as `10`, or `0x01` to be parsed as `1`, where as the standard specifies that the string should contain only digits or hex digits; and Waitress does not support chunk extensions, however it was discarding them without validating that they did not contain illegal characters. This vulnerability has been patched in Waitress 2.1.1. A workaround is available. When deploying a proxy in front of waitress, turning on any and all functionality to make sure that the request matches the RFC7230 standard. Certain proxy servers may not have this functionality though and users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest version of waitress instead.

CVE-2022-24761,1385513396,"CVE-2022-24761 Description: Waitress is a Web Server Gateway Interface server for Python 2 and 3. When using Waitress versions 2.1.0 and prior behind a proxy that does not properly validate the incoming HTTP request matches the RFC7230 standard, Waitress and the frontend proxy may disagree on where one request starts and where it ends. This would allow requests to be smuggled via the front-end proxy to waitress and later behavior. There are two classes of vulnerability that may lead to request smuggling that are addressed by this advisory: The use of Python's `int` to parse strings into integers, leading to ` 10` to be parsed as `10`, or `0x01` to be parsed as `1`, where as the standard specifies that the string should contain only digits or hex digits; and Waitress does not support chunk extensions, however it was discarding them without validating that they did not contain illegal characters. This vulnerability has been patched in Waitress 2.1.1. A workaround is available. When deploying a proxy in front of waitress, turning on any and all functionality to make sure that the request matches the RFC7230 standard. Certain proxy servers may not have this functionality though and users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest version of waitress instead.

CVE-2025-24016,1700967082,"Wazuh Remote Code Execution - PoC Vulnerability Summary A critical RCE vulnerability has been identified in the Wazuh server due to unsafe deserialization in the wazuh-manager package. This bug affects Wazuh versions ≥ 4.4.0 and has been patched in version 4.9.1. Details The flaw lies in the Wazuh API's DistributedAPI, where user-controlled input is unsafely deserialized. This allows attackers with API access to execute arbitrary Python code on the master server using the runas endpoint. Proof of Concept ```POST /security/user/authenticate/runas HTTP/1.1 Host: target.com:55000 Authorization: Basic d2F6dXcta3dpTUltUzNjcjM3UDA1MHItOg== Content-Type: application/json { ""unhandledexc"": { ""class"": ""exit"", ""args"": } }``` The Authorization header is the base64 of `wazuh-wui:MyS3cr37P450r.-` . The payload causes the Wazuh server to shut down by calling Python's `exit` method. Impact Full Remote Code Execution via the API Server Shutdown in PoC Risk of lateral movement across Wazuh clusters Mitigation Upgrade to Wazuh v4.9.1 or higher Avoid exposing the API externally Monitor unusual API activity Stay sharp, hackers!

CVE-2025-24016,1700967082,"Wazuh Remote Code Execution - PoC Vulnerability Summary A critical RCE vulnerability has been identified in the Wazuh server due to unsafe deserialization in the wazuh-manager package. This bug affects Wazuh versions ≥ 4.4.0 and has been patched in version 4.9.1. Details The flaw lies in the Wazuh API's DistributedAPI, where user-controlled input is unsafely deserialized. This allows attackers with API access to execute arbitrary Python code on the master server using the runas endpoint. Proof of Concept ```POST /security/user/authenticate/runas HTTP/1.1 Host: target.com:55000 Authorization: Basic d2F6dXcta3dpTUltUzNjcjM3UDA1MHItOg== Content-Type: application/json { ""unhandledexc"": { ""class"": ""exit"", ""args"": } }``` The Authorization header is the base64 of `wazuh-wui:MyS3cr37P450r.-` . The payload causes the Wazuh server to shut down by calling Python's `exit` method. Impact Full Remote Code Execution via the API Server Shutdown in PoC Risk of lateral movement across Wazuh clusters Mitigation Upgrade to Wazuh v4.9.1 or higher Avoid exposing the API externally Monitor unusual API activity Stay sharp, hackers!

When Windows File Explorer detects a .library-ms file in a folder, it automatically starts parsing it. If the file contains a link to a remote SMB share, an NTLM authentication handshake begins. An attacker controlling the SMB share can intercept the NTLMv2 hash, crack it, or use it in pass-the-hash attacks. But how does an attacker deliver such a file to the victim?

The vulnerability is from the ( The VM vendors didn't highlight it ( A week later, on March 18, researcher 0x6rss ( and a PoC exploit. According to him, the vulnerability is exploited in the wild, and the exploit has likely been ( since November 2024. The point is this. When Windows File Explorer detects a .library-ms file in a folder, it automatically starts parsing it. If the file contains a link to a remote SMB share, an NTLM authentication handshake begins. An attacker controlling the SMB share can intercept the NTLMv2 hash, crack it, or use it in pass-the-hash attacks. But how does an attacker deliver such a file to the victim? It turns out that just extracting a ZIP/RAR archive with the file is enough to trigger the exploit. No need to open the file. This is super effective for phishing.

The previous ways of their operation gave attackers the opportunity to partially compromise the security system of the affected platforms, and the new one (Mark Ermolov, can lead to its complete hacking under the threats, equipped with Intel Pentium processors, Celeron and atom of Denverton families, Apollo Lake, Apollo Lake Gemini Lake and Gemini Lake Refresh. Now the release of these chips is terminated, but they are still used in some and built-in systems, such as (the first scenario of a possible attack is the introduction of a spy program through the assembly stage at the assembly or repair stage. local access to extract encryption and introduce malicious code into the firmware of the Intel CSME subsystem. A similar malicious program with a high degree of probability will not be able to identify standard security functions, such as Intel Boot Guard or Virtualization-Based Security, and all existing antiviruses. For the time being, remaining unnoticed, the malicious code can start sending users to attackers, block access to the device, delete and encrypt the data of carriers and perform other dangerous actions, ”explained Mark Ermolov. Scenario number two - bypassing copyright protection tools for access to the protected content of streaming services. The same methodology for compromising can be used to bypass the mechanisms of protection and copying data in some models of Amazon electronic books, which uses vulnerable Intel Atom processors. The third opportunity that the discovered vector gives is access to data on encrypted media. Such attacks can be used for stealing a laptop or tablet based on these processors.

CVE-2025-24071,1389399945,"PT ESC experts have found attempts to operate the vulnerabilities of the CVE-2025-24071 vulnerability (affecting the wide range of Windows operating systems, including server and client versions of Windows 10 and Windows 11, was detected on March 11. CVE-2025-24071 is associated with the file processing mechanism in Windows in Windows Explorer and the indexing system-they automatically analyze the file of `.Library-mass`, extracted during unpacking the malicious archive and containing a link to the SMB resource. The victim’s accounts can be used for the first time. The description and ROS of vulnerability (a 0x6rsS researcher on his blog. Experts also (that vulnerability can be used while maintaining a file with an expansion of `.Libry-mass` from an electronic letter. Despite the fact that the data about the vulnerability were published a couple of days ago, the attackers are not sleeping Attempts to operate CVE-2025-24071 in organizations in Russia and the Republic of Belarus. Attacks distribute archives that contain a document in PDF format and a file `.Library-mass`. The victim unpackens the archive and launches a PDF-Prime, while the file `.Library-mass` automatically and imperceptibly for the user sends data to the command center of attackers. PT ESC experts predict a surge in attacks using this vulnerability. We recommend the following protection methods: • limit the compounds for SMB protocol to external servers. • Update Windows to the latest version. • prohibit the launch of files with the extension of `.Library-mass`. • block the receipt of files with the extension of `.Library-mass` by e-mail.
