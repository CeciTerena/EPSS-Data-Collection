    "text": "#TL;DR\n\n* Windows Defender is not wrong, per se. `WinRing0` DOES has a vulnerability that lets unprivileged programs *hack into Windows.\n* Fan Control is not malicious, `WinRing0` is not malicious, but a malicious program can use `WinRing0` to bypass your system's security measures because it has a vulnerability.\n* Read source 1 for the technical details.\n* You don't have to read this entire wall of text, skip to the headers that interests you.\n\n# Introduction\n\nHello everyone! As you probably found out by now, Fan Control's implementation is currently broken. This is due to the kernel driver that Fan Control uses `WinRing0` being blocked by Windows Defender.\n\nI want to clarify a few things I learned while researching this and show a bit of behind the scenes of how your computer talks to Fan Control and why Defender has blocked it.\n\n# Pet Peeve\n\nFirst off, as a computer scientist it pains me to see people's knee jerk reaction is to override their operating system's security systems. It's there to protect you, yes it can make mistakes, but you should generally wait for an official response or similar understanding and you shouldn't do it blindly. Your security means nothing if you override your security when it's inconvenient.\n\nIt's kind of like taking the carbon monoxide alarm off the wall because you don't like that it's beeping super loudly.\n\nAnyways.\n\n# What is a driver and why do we need them?\n^(skip to next header if you don't care how drivers work)\n\nTo answer why Defender has blocked fan Control, I first have to explain how Fan Control works with Windows. I'll try to keep this explanation as simple as possible. *^(Asterisks indicate an oversimplification for clarity)\n\nWindow's main job is to manage a bunch of different applications and allow them to talk to the hardware. In old times it used to be the case that a program can tell the computer to do whatever it wants. This was a problem because it could mess up other programs, crash the entire system, and do malicious things.\n\nSo to fix this, operating systems (OS) now split up the computer's memory and give a piece to each application. This application now has its own space to do things, called user-space. Each application is *only allowed to do things in its own piece of memory and nothing else. If the application crashed, the OS can throw away the application & its piece of memory and everything else on the system will be fine.\n\nThis has a big problem though: applications isolated in user-space could not talk to hardware! If you can talk to the hardware, you can do anything to the system, so it's an intentional protection. But your hardware needs to talk to the operating system to work, but there is too many pieces of hardware that all work differently. Windows doesn't know how to talk to all of them!\n\nSo we need these programs that can interface with hardware but can't live in user-space. But at the same time we want the kind of protection that user-space gives.\n\nThe solution is drivers: special programs that can receive special exceptions to live in *kernel-space. Kernel-space is the opposite of user-space. You can do anything in kernel-space! Like talk to hardware to control your fans or read your credit card number when you pay for something. Because kernel-space drivers are so high risk Microsoft gate keeps them with an iron fist, kinda like Apple's non-EU app store on iPhones.\n\n# Fan Control used a driver called `WinRing0`\n\nFan Control cannot talk directly to your hardware. It can talk to a driver, and that driver can talk to the hardware. There are a few different drivers and api's Fan Control uses, but the main one was `WinRing0`.\n\n### Who made `WinRing0`?\n\n`WinRing0` is a third party driver developed by OpenLibSys.\n\n### Who convinced Microsoft to let `WinRing0` be a driver with privileges?\n\nThe company called EVGA convinced Microsoft. Why? Because EVGA made software that used the third party driver. They don't use it anymore because it was vulnerable.\n\n# `WinRing0` is a vulnerable driver!\n\nThis is why Defender hates `WinRing0`.\n\nOn August 11th, 2020 a security researcher named Matt Hand published¹ the vulnerability report for `WinRing0` proving that it had a high-risk privilege escalation exploit. This means a user-space program can take control of this driver* and then use it to gain kernel-space privileges. This means a lowly application can take advantage of `WinRing0` to do whatever it wants to your computer!\n\nWhen this was discovered, EVGA abandoned `WinRing0` and made their own proprietary driver that they use. The developers of `WinRing0` can fix the driver, but under Microsoft's modern strict driver rules, an updated `WinRing0` won't make it past Microsoft's driver gate keepers.\n\nMany projects used and still use this driver. That's why Microsoft couldn't just cut support outright for the driver- too many things would break all at once. But `WinRing0` was on borrowed time, Microsoft planned to cut the driver in 2024, but then they pushed it back to Jan 2025. And now Microsoft seems to start following through.\n\n# What are the risks of running a vulnerable driver?\n\nWell a vulnerable driver is basically a front door to your house that you cannot lock. If everyone in town is friendly, you're good. But all it takes is one malicious actor to recognize the vulnerable door and waltz right on in.\n\nThe door still functions, and friendly programs like Fan Control are respectful when they have to go in your house through the door.\n\nBut you are less protected while having it installed. I would recommend listening to Defender. If you choose to override Defender, know that your OS's front door is open, and any program you run can use it for whatever they wish.\n\n# Sources\n1) Matt Hand (security researcher), https://medium.com/@matterpreter/cve-2020-14979-local-privilege-escalation-in-evga-precisionx1-cf63c6b95896\n2) CVE Database, https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2020-14979\n3) Related Github issue, https://github.com/LibreHardwareMonitor/LibreHardwareMonitor/issues/984\n4) Fan Control Dev, https://www.reddit.com/r/JayzTwoCents/comments/13nwpzq/comment/jldj1o9/\n\nFeel free to ask questions, there's no such thing as a stupid question on my posts.",

        "text": "It's not true that EVGA was anyhow involved in the WinRing0 driver. They were just one of many companies that used it as it was easy to integrate it and open-source. And the driver+signature was accepted by Windows kernel because it used the old (attestation / cross-certified) signing method that was sufficient several years ago and didn't require an expensive EV code-signing certificate. Signing requirements for kernel drivers changed after Win10 release but drivers signed before were still accepted to preserve compatibility. No one had to convince MS to accept that driver, you just bough a certificate for Windows kernel code signing (with MS cross-cert), signed your driver and it worked. The author of WinRing0 had such certificate probably also for other projects he was working on. Today, you need a more expensive EV certificate (issued to businesses only) and need to let MS sign your driver on their portal (validated via customer EV cert).",

    "title": "Lessons from Next.js Middleware vulnerability CVE-2025-29927: Why Route-Level Auth Checks Are Worth the Extra Work",
    "text": "Hey r/nextjs community,\n\nWith the recent disclosure of CVE-2025-29927 (the Next.js middleware bypass vulnerability), I wanted to share some thoughts on an authentication patterns that I always use in all my projects and that can help keep your apps secure, even in the face of framework-level vulnerabilities like this.\n\nFor those who haven't heard, Vercel recently disclosed a critical vulnerability in Next.js middleware. By adding a special header (`x-middleware-subrequest`) to requests, attackers can completely bypass middleware-based authentication checks. This affects apps that rely on middleware for auth or security checks without additional validation at the route level.\n\nWe can all agree that middleware-based auth is convenient (implement once, protect many routes), this vulnerability highlights why checking auth at the route level provides an additional layer of security. Yes, it's more verbose and requires more code, but it creates a defense-in-depth approach that's resilient to middleware bypasses.\n\nHere's a pattern I've been using, some people always ask why I don't just use the middleware, but that incident proves its effectiveness.   \n  \n**First, create a requireAuth function:**\n\n    export async function requireAuth(Roles: Role[] = []) {\n      const session = await auth();\n    \n      if (!session) {\n        return redirect('/signin');\n      }\n    \n      if (Roles.length && !userHasRoles(session.user, Roles)) {\n        return { authorized: false, session };\n      }\n    \n      return { authorized: true, session };\n    }\n    \n    // Helper function to check roles\n    function userHasRoles(user: Session[\"user\"], roles: Role[]) {\n      const userRoles = user?.roles || [];\n      const userRolesName = userRoles.map((role) => role.role.name);\n      return roles.every((role) => userRolesName.includes(role));\n    }\n\n**Then, implement it in every route that needs protection:**\n\n    export default async function AdminPage() {\n      const { authorized } = await requireAuth([Role.ADMIN]);\n    \n      if (!authorized) return <Unauthorized />;\n    \n      // Your protected page content\n      return (\n        <div>\n          <h1>Admin Dashboard</h1>\n          {/* Rest of your protected content */}\n        </div>\n      );\n    }\n\n# Benefits of This Approach\n\n1. **Resilience to middleware vulnerabilities**: Even if middleware is bypassed, each route still performs its own auth check\n2. **Fine-grained control**: Different routes can require different roles or permissions\n3. **Explicit security**: Makes the security requirements of each route clear in the code\n4. **Early returns**: Auth failures are handled before any sensitive logic executes\n\nI use [Next.js Full-Stack-Kit](https://full-stack-kit.dev) for several projects and it implements this pattern consistently across all protected routes. What I like about that pattern is that auth checks aren't hidden away in some middleware config - they're right there at the top of each page component, making the security requirements explicit and reviewable.\n\nAt first, It might seem tedious to add auth checks to every route (especially when you have dozens of them), this vulnerability shows why that extra work is worth it. Defense in depth is a fundamental security principle, and implementing auth checks at multiple levels can save you from framework-level vulnerabilities.\n\nStay safe guys!",

If it's simple condition like signin status or role and same rule would be applied to whole segment anyway, there's no need to spread it to each child route. Also you'd avoid more expensive RSC execution in case a redirect is necessary.\n\n\nIf the check is more granular e.g. \"....where id=? and foo.owner=?\", 123, user.id)\" then it needs to be done at data access layer obviously. \n\n\nDoing **authentication** in middleware or equivalent concept is another thing.

I’m not the sort of dev who typically obsesses much about perf, but this scenario is one exception.\n\nMy understanding (correct me if I’m wrong) is that for a typical app with a partially personalised UI - e.g. a dashboard with the user’s avatar in the top-right - most of the outer app “shell” is static (i.e. the same thing is shown to all users). In this case, it feels wrong to me to dump a blocking auth service check in middleware. Instead, you could conceivably render parts of the screen immediately and then any slower, user-specific elements stream in and replace their skeleton loaders.\n\nAdditionally, you only need to do a single db/auth service hit to verify a user, as this result can then just use React’s cache function to reuse the result across the same server render pass.\n\nOne final pattern I’ve been using is “optimistic” session checks in middleware, which is basically instant as it only checks for a JWT. Of course it’s technically not secure because it could be tampered with, but for rendering basic user data there’s no issue. And for operations that really need full server security, you use row-level security, auth guards in RSCs, server actions, etc. In this way, you get immediate UI rendering with secure data access (it’s just a bit more cumbersome than having a single middleware check).\n\nI think seb markbage supports this pattern from one of his tweets. Also could be a motivating factor for features like partial pre-rendering",

Asymmetric ones will be slower but even if it would take 1ms you are completely fine for blocking for 1ms in any typical web application. \n\n\nSessions make much less sense for distributed system but if you're close to db it's perfectly viable. Usually it's just a single index lookup which should be very fast. Again shouldn't be an issue. Most framework default to doing this every request and it isn't an issue.\n\n\nWhy this is an issue with NextJS? Because middleware runs possibly 10000km away from the data. Also people do crazy things like calling an external server ( Supabase for example) to do the auth check which obviously is extremely slow. \n\n\nMy advice? Use JWT and just validate it locally. Extremely fast and simple.",

        "text": "What’s everyone’s thoughts on passkeys these days?\n\nThe root cause of this CVE is that the authenticator (your BLE security key) has no built-in mechanism to independently verify the authenticity of the host (domain) it’s communicating with. This absence of “host verification” allows attackers to MITM the BLE-based authentication, redirecting legitimate responses to malicious endpoints.\n\nCool. So your fancy BLE security key basically trusts whoever it connects with over Bluetooth, without ever double-checking who’s on the other end. Oops.\n\nNot an easy fix, but clearly authenticators need a way to explicitly verify the domain before signing responses. Without domain validation PassKeys are vulnerable to subtle but powerful MITM attacks like this one.\n\nAs far as mitigations I can think of a few:\n\nBLE Domain Binding:\n\nEnhance the security of BLE keys by incorporating explicit domain checks directly into the BLE handshake. This would ensure that the authenticator independently verifies the host’s identity, preventing unauthorized access from third-party devices.\n\nOut-of-Band Domain Checks:\n\nImplement a secondary, trusted channel (such as NFC or a “tap-to-confirm” feature on the security device) to validate the domain requesting PassKey credentials. This would provide an additional layer of verification before the device trusts the request without hesitation.\n\nChallenge-Based Verification:\n\nHave the authenticator issue a cryptographic challenge specifically tied to the domain. The authenticator won’t finalize the authentication unless the host proves its legitimacy cryptographically. In other words, make the domain prove it’s not an imposter first.",

    "text": "**// Overview**\n\nOn March 19th, 2025, software vendor Veeam announced a patch to address **CVE-2025-23120,** which allows for remote code execution (RCE) by any domain authenticated users. The CVSS score is 9.9 representing a serious risk, however this impacts only AD Domain-joined backup servers.\n\nThe attack takes advantage of a deserialization vulnerability in two different .NET classes. Deserialization is a process to reassemble data after it has been broken into smaller pieces in a stream of bytes known as serialization. The vendor, watchTowr, who reported the vulnerability to Veeam, made note to mention the process of relying on deny-lists, instead of accept-lists is one of the root causes, as it allows attackers to attempt to identify other classes which are not blocked to facilitate code execution.\n\nAs Sophos has previously reported\\[1\\], Veeam backup servers are frequently targeted by financially motivated threat actors to encrypt and ransom an organization’s data. We recommend high priority be given to patching your backup servers if they meet the criteria below. In addition, Sophos does support Veeam integration to further strengthen your protections\\[2\\].\n\n**// What you should do**\n\nCustomers running Veeam Backup & Replication software products are advised to upgrade to version 12.3.1, or apply the latest hotfix 12.3 following the vendor’s specific guidance:\n\n1. 12.3.0.310 and all earlier builds of version 12 are impacted\n\nPlease be advised that application of this hotfix may overwrite previous hotfixes per Veeam’s guidance.\n\n  \n[https://www.veeam.com/kb4724](https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fvd5djq9e.r.us-west-2.awstrack.me%2FL0%2Fhttps%3A%252F%252Fwww.veeam.com%252Fkb4724%2F1%2F01010195ba6e1dc2-bee103a9-f191-4ba1-a15f-643badbd5c97-000000%2FcE1OH5jf1aN1IMb1iHbmpRTfxSU%3D419&data=05%7C02%7Cjasoncohenour%40ovfcu.com%7Cdaf7a7bdfae64826d3ff08dd68b865f0%7Cf5ea2130c88948fa8b41bbb81c80157e%7C0%7C0%7C638781863399659476%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=K0kuV3JbE1IPQIegL3zU0vPOVGrB0Sv6Z6Cap0bh0Ko%3D&reserved=0)\n\nAdditional Reporting\n\n1.

    "text": "Link to blogpost: [https://www.wiz.io/blog/ingress-nginx-kubernetes-vulnerabilities](https://www.wiz.io/blog/ingress-nginx-kubernetes-vulnerabilities)  \n  \nWiz Research just disclosed a new set of unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities in Ingress NGINX Controller for Kubernetes (nicknamed **IngressNightmare**). These are serious — with a CVSS v3.1 base score of **9.8**, and they allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the cluster’s Ingress NGINX Controller pod and potentially access *all secrets across all namespaces*. If you’re running Kubernetes in production, please read on.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* **Vulnerabilities:** CVE-2025-1097, CVE-2025-1098, CVE-2025-24514, CVE-2025-1974\n* **Severity:** Critical (9.8 CVSS v3.1)\n* **Potential Impact:** Full cluster takeover (access to all secrets in the cluster).\n* **Affected Component:** Admission controller inside Ingress NGINX (a very commonly used ingress controller).\n\n**Summary**  \nIngress NGINX Controller is massively popular. Wiz says they’ve found **over 6,500** publicly exposed clusters – including some at Fortune 500 companies – that have the admission controller wide open to the internet, making them critical targets.\n\nIngress NGINX by default deploys a validating webhook (admission controller) that checks incoming ingress objects for compliance. But in these vulnerable versions, that webhook can be abused to inject malicious NGINX configs. That eventually leads to RCE within the Ingress NGINX pod. Combine that with the admission controller’s elevated privileges, and it’s game over.\n\n**Affected Versions / Fix**\n\n* **Fixed in:** Ingress NGINX Controller versions `1.12.1` and `1.11.5`.\n* If you’re running an older release, you’re at risk. Patch ASAP.\n\n**Mitigation Steps**\n\n1. **Update** to the latest Ingress NGINX Controller (1.12.1+ or 1.11.5+).\n2. **Lock down the admission webhook** so it’s only reachable by the Kubernetes API Server.\n   * This means restricting network policies or ensuring the webhook isn’t publicly exposed.\n3. **If you can’t patch**, you can:\n   * Temporarily **disable** the validating webhook by removing the `ingress-nginx-admission` ValidatingWebhookConfiguration and the `--validating-webhook` argument. (But remember: re-enable it once you upgrade, because it does serve useful security checks!)\n   * Apply **strict network policies** so only the K8s control plane can talk to this webhook.",

    "title": "Critical Vulnerability: CrushFTP CVE-2025-31161 Auth Bypass and Post-Exploitation",
    "text": "**TL;DR:** CVE-2025-31161 is a critical severity vulnerability allowing attackers to control how user authentication is handled by CrushFTP managed file transfer (MFT) software. **We strongly recommend patching immediately to avoid affected versions 10.0.0 through 10.8.3 and 11.0.0 through 11.3.0.** Successful exploitation of CVE-2025-31161 would give attackers admin level access across the CrushFTP application for further compromise.\n\nOn 3 April 2025, Huntress observed in-the-wild exploitation of CVE-2025-31161, an authentication bypass vulnerability in versions of the CrushFTP software. We uncovered further post-exploitation activity leveraging the MeshCentral agent and other malware that we will discuss in [this writeup. ](https://www.huntress.com/blog/crushftp-cve-2025-31161-auth-bypass-and-post-exploitation?utm_campaign=rapid-response&utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social) While doing some further analysis, we uncovered potential evidence of compromise as early as 30 March 2025, which seemed to be testing access, and did not spawn any external processes to CrushFTP.\n\nIn [a recent post](https://x.com/Shadowserver/status/1906753539499520064) from the ShadowServer team, they state as of March 30 there were [\\~1,500 vulnerable instances](https://dashboard.shadowserver.org/statistics/honeypot/vulnerability/time-series/?date_range=7&host_type=src&vendor=crushftp&vulnerability=cve-2025-2825&dataset=unique_ips&limit=1000&group_by=geo&style=stacked) of CrushFTP publicly exposed to the internet.\n\nWe have published a proof of concept, IOCs, and analysis on Mesh and AnyDesk post exploitations [in this blog](https://www.huntress.com/blog/crushftp-cve-2025-31161-auth-bypass-and-post-exploitation?utm_campaign=rapid-response&utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social).\n\n# What is CVE-2025-31161? \n\n[CVE-2025-31161](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-31161) is a **9.8 CVSS** critical severity vulnerability that affects how the CrushFTP file transfer application handles user authentication. At the time of writing, the NIST NVD entry states the description:\n\n>*CrushFTP versions 10.0.0 through 10.8.3 and 11.0.0 through 11.3.0 are affected by a vulnerability in the S3 authorization header processing that allows authentication bypass. Remote and unauthenticated HTTP requests to CrushFTP with known usernames can be used to impersonate a user and conduct actions on their behalf, including administrative actions and data retrieval.*\n\nThis vulnerability [is patched](https://www.crushftp.com/crush11wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=Update) and is mitigated in CrushFTP versions 11.3.1+ and 10.8.4+. Huntress has validated and confirmed the authentication bypass is prevented in patched versions. \n\nPlease ensure your own installations of CrushFTP are updated to the latest versions. If your CrushFTP instance is publicly exposed to the open Internet, **we strongly recommend you patch immediately.**\n\nUpon successful exploitation, an adversary may gain access to the administrator user account for the CrushFTP application, and leverage this to create new backdoor accounts, access files (upload and download), obtain code execution, and achieve full control of the vulnerable server.\n\nThe vulnerability was assigned a CVE on March 26, and the Shadowserver Foundation first reported CVE-2025-31161 exploitation activity on March 31. The exploitation of CVE-2025-31161 is indicative of a concerning trend that we’ve seen [across several incidents](https://www.huntress.com/blog/threat-advisory-oh-no-cleo-cleo-software-actively-being-exploited-in-the-wild), where threat actors are targeting MFT platforms as a way to deliver disruptive attacks. These platforms are typically external-facing and house sensitive enterprise data, making them a favorite for threat actors. As such, prompt patching is critical. Within our partner base we have seen 148 unique endpoints with the CrushFTP software installed as a service, with 95 of these running major versions 10 and 11.  Approximately 72 different companies within our customer base were currently running unpatched versions of CrushFTP.  **Customers have been notified of the urgency to upgrade.**\n\nNumerous other security firms have discussed CVE-2025-31161 (hat tip to [Rapid7 AttackerKB](https://attackerkb.com/topics/k0EgiL9Psz/cve-2025-2825/rapid7-analysis) and [Outpost24](https://outpost24.com/blog/crushftp-auth-bypass-vulnerability/) amongst others) and thanks to their shared insights, Huntress was able to recreate a proof-of-concept (PoC) with ease. The core of this vulnerability is the S3 authentication functionality included as a part of CrushFTP. Due to logic bugs in the underlying source code (which [Project Discovery did a fantastic job](https://projectdiscovery.io/blog/crushftp-authentication-bypass) outlining), a mere **Authorization** header in an HTTP request is all that is needed to bypass authentication without valid username or password credentials.\n\n# What is Huntress Doing? \n\nPost-exploitation efforts are already thoroughly covered by Huntress detection rules.

Had updated AMD Chipset Driver to 7.01.08.129 before and after the F5 BIOS update. Got random 4d error on boot up, stuck on the screen with Aorus logo without the spinning wheel.\n\nTried reset BIOS to default settings, no help. Tried turning off PSU then hold power button for 30 secs, no good. Redownload and reflash F5 bios again then turn off memory restore context. Things seems to work well. On boot up the next day, remember I haven't turn on secure boot after reflashing BIOS. Turn it back on and the random 4d boot up error start happening again. Afterwards, I noticed some of the BIOS settings was changed after secure boot changes, including memory context restore changing back to auto. Turned it off, thought everything was stable. Turned on my PC the next day and it got stuck with 4d error again. Seems like there's something wrong with secure boot or the way I turned it on. User standard/custom mode both causes 4d error randomly. But when it boot successfully, everything works fine. Did a quick 30 min CPU+RAM and RAM test via OCCT and nothing was found.\n\nAny help please?",

    "text": "\n**Trend Micro has discovered a critical security flaw in Nvidia's patch for the Container Toolkit that still leaves AI environments vulnerable to attacks.**\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n- Trend Micro flags Nvidia's incomplete patch for a critical vulnerability.\n- The flaw allows potential container escape attacks and unauthorized access.\n- Organizations using Nvidia's toolkit are directly at risk, especially with default settings.\n- The patch doesn't properly enforce checks against race conditions, allowing exploitation.\n- A denial-of-service flaw has also been identified affecting Docker on Linux systems.\n\nTrend Micro researchers have flagged significant issues with Nvidia's patching of a critical vulnerability found in the Nvidia Container Toolkit, originally addressed last September. The vulnerability, identified as CVE-2024-0132, scored an alarming 9 out of 10 on the CVSS scale, categorizing it as high priority. However, Trend Micro's findings indicate that the patch is not fully effective, leaving enterprises exposed to dangerous container escape attacks. Such vulnerabilities enable hackers to execute arbitrary commands and access sensitive data, putting organizations' proprietary information at significant risk.\n\nThe security gap lies in the incomplete enforcement of checks that would typically prevent exploitation via the time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition. This flaw allows a crafted container to maneuver past isolation barriers and manipulate host resources. The potential fallout from such exploitation includes theft of sensitive information, prolonged system downtime, and substantial operational disruptions. Organizations relying on the Nvidia Container Toolkit for their AI workloads and Docker environments must be aware of these risks, particularly those operating with default configurations or the newer features of the toolkit.\n\nAdditionally, alongside this vulnerability, Trend Micro has pointed out a related denial-of-service issue specifically affecting Docker configurations on Linux systems. Containers using specific mount options can lead to unchecked growth in the Linux mount table, creating a service disruption that can hinder remote access and overall operation. To mitigate these threats, Trend Micro advocates for stricter access controls and the disabling of unnecessary features within the Nvidia toolkit.\n\nHow are organizations adapting their security strategies in light of this Nvidia vulnerability?\n\n**Learn More:** [Security Week](https://www.securityweek.com/trend-micro-flags-incomplete-nvidia-patch-that-leaves-ai-containers-exposed/)\n\n**Want to stay updated on the latest cyber threats?** \n\n 👉 **[Subscribe to /r/PwnHub](https://www.reddit.com/r/pwnhub)**",

So lautet eine der Grundregeln des Internets, die natürlich auch Autos betrifft. Denn mittlerweile ist eine beachtliche Anzahl an Fahrzeugen dauerhaft vernetzt. Wie gravierend ein solcher Cyberangriff sich auf die Sicherheit von Leib und Leben auswirken kann, zeigen Forscher von PCAutomotive: Den Sicherheitsspezialisten ist es gelungen, einen Nissan verdeckt aus der Ferne zu kapern und zu steuern.\n\n[Golden Dayz \\/ shutterstock.com](https://preview.redd.it/ainwaentmzue1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d375e81c6c5b5d452d0a3535af0ae96385a6c3a7)\n\n# Vernetzung macht Autos verwundbarer\n\nGeht es nach einer Einschätzung von statista, wird im Jahr 2030 rund die Hälfte des europäischen Pkw-Bestands – etwa 255 Millionen Fahrzeuge – mit dem Internet verbunden sein. Blickt man weiter ins Jahr 2035, dürfte dieser Anteil in den USA bereits bei nahezu 100 Prozent der 290 Millionen Fahrzeuge liegen. Auch China zieht nach: Dort sollen bis dahin rund 72 Prozent der 350 Millionen Autos als Connected Cars unterwegs sein.\n\nDamit ist die Mehrheit der Fahrzeuge in diesen Ländern bereits vernetzt, Tendenz steigend. Dies bringt jedoch nicht nur Fortschritt und Komfort, sondern öffnet auch neue Angriffsmöglichkeiten für Kriminelle. Mit der zunehmenden Vernetzung der Fahrzeuge steigt das Risiko von Cyberangriffen, die von Datendiebstahl bis hin zur Manipulation von Fahrfunktionen reichen können.\n\n# Über Bluetooth eingehackt\n\nInwieweit sich tatsächlich sensible Fahrfunktionen kapern lassen, haben IT-Sicherheitsexperten von PCAutomotive auf der Hackerkonferenz Black Hat Asia 2025 demonstriert. Für ihre Präsentation verwendeten sie einen Nissan Leaf der zweiten Generation, Baujahr 2020.\n\nDabei erfolgte der Angriff durch ein Einfallstor in der Bluetooth-Schnittstelle des Elektroautos. Schwachstellen im Infotainmentsystem ermöglichten darüber hinaus eine Rechteerweiterung und schließlich einen verdeckten Fernzugriff über die Mobilfunkverbindung.\n\n# Dramatische Folgen für die Sicherheit der Insassen\n\nDie Folgen einer solchen Schwachstelle könnten kaum gravierender sein. Angreifer können den Standort des Fahrzeugs verfolgen und Inhalte des Infotainment-Bildschirms manipulieren oder mit Screenshots speichern. Gespräche können heimlich aufgezeichnet und sogar über den Lautsprecher des Autos wiedergegeben werden.\n\nEs kommt aber noch schlimmer: Auch physische Funktionen des Kraftfahrzeuges wie Türen, Scheibenwischer, Spiegel, Fenster und auch Leuchten können nach der Hacker-Übernahme sowohl aus dem Stand als auch während der Fahrt ferngesteuert werden.\n\nSogar die Lenkung des Fahrzeugs soll laut [netzwelt.de](http://netzwelt.de) aus der Ferne manipulierbar sein – der Albtraum eines jeden Autofahrers. Was einst nach düsterer Science-Fiction klang, ist heute eine reale und ernstzunehmende Bedrohung.\n\n# Cyberangriffe werden immer noch unterschätzt\n\nLaut der Präsentation von PCAutomotive sind die Cyberexperten auf insgesamt zehn Sicherheitslücken gestoßen. Diese sind mittlerweile unter den Codes PCA\\_NISSAN\\_009, PCA\\_NISSAN\\_012 und CVE-2025-32056 bis CVE-2025-32063 bekannt.\n\nDie Meldung an Nissan erfolgte bereits im August 2023. Dennoch hätten die Gegenmaßnahmen seitens des japanischen Autoherstellers viel Zeit in Anspruch genommen. Details will man bei Nissan aus Sicherheitsgründen nicht preisgeben.\n\nVielleicht aber auch aus Kalkül – denn die Hersteller tun noch immer zu wenig gegen Cyberangriffe. Immer wieder werden neue Schwachstellen bei verschiedenen Marken und Modellen bekannt. Allerdings sind nicht nur die Autobauer Schuld: Cybersicherheit kostet bares Geld und setzt man die Kundenbrille auf, handelt es sich um eine Verbesserung, die man schlicht nicht sehen kann.\n\n# Bußgeldvorwürfe stets über [Geblitzt.de](http://Geblitzt.de) prüfen lassen\n\nBei [Geblitzt.de](http://Geblitzt.de) arbeitet die CODUKA GmbH eng mit großen Anwaltskanzleien zusammen und ermöglicht es Betroffenen, sich gegen Bußgelder, Punkte und Fahrverbote zu wehren.\n\nRechtsschutzversicherungen übernehmen die Kosten eines vollständigen Leistungsspektrums unserer Partnerkanzleien.

    "title": "Microsoft Addresses Windows 11 Users' Concerns About New inetpub Folder",
    "text": "\n**Microsoft has reassured Windows users that the newly appeared inetpub folder is an intentional security measure following recent updates.**\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n- The inetpub folder is created as part of a security update to mitigate a significant vulnerability.\n- Users should not delete the inetpub folder despite its empty appearance.\n- The folder enhances protection against privilege escalation exploits on Windows systems.\n\nWindows 10 and 11 users have recently noticed a seemingly empty directory called 'inetpub' appearing on their systems after installing Microsoft's April 2025 Patch Tuesday updates. While many users may see this folder as unnecessary and consider deleting it, Microsoft has explicitly warned against such action, clarifying that it plays a critical role in protecting systems from exploitation of a newly patched vulnerability, CVE-2025-21204. This vulnerability poses a serious risk as it allows unauthorized users to potentially gain system-level access, posing a significant threat to the integrity of a user's system.\n\nThe inetpub folder is typically associated with Microsoft's Internet Information Services (IIS) web server software. However, even users without IIS installed are affected by this change. The folder is created with specific read-only SYSTEM-level permissions, which enhances security measures against potential privilege escalation attempts. Microsoft reassures users that there is currently no evidence of active exploitation regarding CVE-2025-21204, but maintaining the folder's integrity is key to preventing future security risks. Thus, rather than being a cause for alarm, the folder signifies a proactive step by Microsoft in safeguarding Windows systems.\n\nHow do you feel about Microsoft creating this folder as a security measure without prior user notification?\n\n**Learn More:** [Cyber Security News](https://cybersecuritynews.com/microsoft-asks-windows-11-users/)\n\n**Want to stay updated on the latest cyber threats?** \n\n 👉 **[Subscribe to /r/PwnHub](https://www.reddit.com/r/pwnhub)**",

The leaked data includes highly sensitive assets such as JKS files, encrypted SSO passwords, key files, and enterprise manager JPS keys, affecting over 140,000 tenants. \n\nThe attacker, who has been active since January 2025, is demanding payment for data removal and even incentivizing assistance in decrypting the stolen credentials. Initial analysis suggests the breach may have originated from a vulnerable Oracle login subdomain (login.\\[region\\].oraclecloud.com), possibly linked to CVE-2021-35587—a critical flaw in Oracle Fusion Middleware’s Access Manager.\n\nThe affected endpoint, last updated in 2014, underscores a lack of patch management and highlights broader concerns around supply chain vulnerabilities.

This weakness in the software could allow a low-privileged attacker with local access to exploit the system, resulting in elevated privileges that might enable them to manipulate sensitive data or disrupt operations. With a CVSS score of 6.7, this vulnerability indicates a medium-severity issue that should be taken seriously by all users of the software, especially those on Dell's gaming platforms. Since the Alienware Command Center plays an essential role in system optimization and customization for gamers, the implications of this vulnerability are far-reaching. Successful exploits could lead to unauthorized access to personal data or system disruption, raising serious concerns among users about the integrity of their systems.\n\nResearcher “bugzzzhunter,” who discovered this vulnerability, pointed out that while the exploit does require specific conditions to be met—such as user interaction and low privileges—the potential consequences are significant. Privilege escalation vulnerabilities are particularly alarming because they allow an attacker to gain a more substantial foothold in a compromised system, thus escalating their capabilities. With a history of previous vulnerabilities in Alienware's software, Dell's consistent updating and communication practices are crucial for maintaining user trust. However, given that this vulnerability has now been publicly disclosed, users need to act quickly to apply the necessary updates and protect their systems from potential exploitation.\n\nHave you updated your Alienware Command Center software since the vulnerability disclosure?\n\n**Learn More:** [Cyber Security News](https://cybersecuritynews.com/dell-alienware-command-center-vulnerability/)\n\n**Want to stay updated on the latest cyber threats?** \n\n 👉 **[Subscribe to /r/PwnHub](https://www.reddit.com/r/pwnhub)**",

    "text": "\n**Hackers are actively taking advantage of a serious vulnerability in Windows systems, CVE-2025-24054, to leak sensitive authentication data.**\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n- Vulnerability facilitates NTLM hash leakage through spoofing techniques.\n- Attackers can escalate privileges and move laterally within networks.\n- Exploitation requires minimal user interaction, increasing risk.\n- Recent campaigns target government and private institutions in Eastern Europe.\n\nCybercriminals are currently exploiting a severe vulnerability identified as CVE-2025-24054, which relates to the NTLM authentication protocol used within Windows systems. This vulnerability allows attackers to manipulate file path handling in a way that triggers SMB authentication requests, revealing user NTLM hashes through unsuspecting file operations. What makes this exploit particularly concerning is its ability to occur with minimal user interaction, such as simply unzipping a ZIP file that contains a malicious .library-ms file. As soon as the file is extracted, the user's authentication data can be leaked, paving the way for further exploitation by the attackers.\n\nRecent reports indicate that threat actors began utilizing this vulnerability shortly after Microsoft's attempted patch on March 11, 2025. Campaigns observed in late March specifically targeted institutions in Poland and Romania, showcasing the vulnerability's appeal to malicious groups. By embedding harmful files in spear-phishing emails, attackers prompted unwitting users to execute the harmful ZIP archives, triggering the vulnerability and exposing their NTLM hashes. The attackers were then able to leverage these hashes for lateral movements within networks, thereby gaining unauthorized access and potentially escalating privileges, all while evading detection.\n\nWhat measures do you think organizations should prioritize in response to such rapidly exploited vulnerabilities?\n\n**Learn More:** [Cyber Security News](https://cybersecuritynews.com/hackers-exploiting-ntlm-spoofing-vulnerability/)\n\n**Want to stay updated on the latest cyber threats?** \n\n 👉 **[Subscribe to /r/PwnHub](https://www.reddit.com/r/pwnhub)**",

The flaw includes:\n\n• Exploitable firmware/module updates\n• Weak RNG entropy → brute-forceable keypairs\n• Remote signature injection & transaction hijacking\n\nThis isn’t just about one chip — it’s about a fundamental design flaw:\n🔹 If trust is rooted in hardware, the system is only as strong as its weakest microcontroller.\n\nWhat We Did Instead\nWe’ve been working on an architecture that treats trust as behavior, not assumption.\n\nNo reliance on global consensus or secure hardware. Instead:\n\n• Agents validate state locally\n• Trust scores are based on entropy quality, signature patterns, and behavior\n• Adaptive PoW rejects anomalies — even if signed\n• Entropy audits detect weak randomness in real time\n• Devices that act “out of spec” are automatically isolated or demoted\n\nIf a key becomes guessable or spoofed, the system doesn’t alert — it acts.\n\nBig Picture:\nCryptography isn’t just math.\nIt’s entropy. It’s behavior. It’s architecture.\n\nThe next evolution in blockchain security won't come from stronger chips.\nIt’ll come from smarter systems that expect them to fail.\n\nLet me know if anyone’s working on similar agent-based or entropy-scoring models.

    "text": "*Today, the cybersecurity community faced a critical juncture as the U.S. government's contract with MITRE Corporation to develop, operate and modernize the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) program, as well as related efforts like CWE, was set to expire.*\n\n[Adam Khan, April 16, 2025](https://blog.barracuda.com/2025/04/16/cve-program-funding-crisis)\n\nToday, the cybersecurity community faced a critical juncture as the U.S. government's contract with MITRE Corporation to develop, operate and modernize the [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) program](https://cve.mitre.org/), as well as related efforts like CWE, was set to expire.\n\nMITRE warned of \"multiple impacts to CVE, including deterioration of national vulnerability databases and advisories, tool vendors, incident response operations, and all manner of critical infrastructure.\"\n\nThis development threatened the continuity of a foundational element in global cybersecurity infrastructure. In a last-minute intervention, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) extended funding and awarded an 11-month bridge contract to ensure there would be no lapse in CVE services.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lbyeumybt9ve1.png?width=375&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb7f0728ef1ca829568cdf3a1255c5d8ebce97e7\n\n# Understanding the CVE Program\n\nThe CVE program, established in 1999 and managed by MITRE, provides a standardized system for identifying and cataloging publicly known cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Each vulnerability is assigned a unique identifier (e.g., CVE-2025-12345), facilitating consistent communication among security professionals, vendors and organizations worldwide.\n\nCVE records are categorized based on the type of vulnerability, affected software or hardware, and potential impact. These records typically include a brief description, references to public advisories or patches, and severity ratings, when available.\n\nThe lifecycle of a CVE follows a structured process:\n\n1. **Discovery** – A researcher, vendor or organization identifies a potential security flaw.\n2. **Submission** – The issue is reported to a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA), which validates and assigns a CVE ID.\n3. **Disclosure** – After validation, the vulnerability is publicly disclosed either by the discoverer or the CNA, depending on coordination.\n4. **Publication** – The CVE entry is published to the CVE List and made available to the community for integration into tools and databases.\n5. **Ongoing Maintenance** – MITRE and CNAs monitor for corrections, updates and additional reference material to keep the records accurate and useful.\n\nThe CVE program serves as a backbone for security tools and frameworks such as the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), which augments CVE records with CVSS scores and metadata, and the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE), which categorizes the underlying flaw types.\n\nBy offering a centralized, transparent, and community-driven system, the CVE program supports timely vulnerability management and helps coordinate global response efforts.\n\n# Importance of the CVE program\n\nThe CVE program is foundational to global cybersecurity efforts for several reasons:\n\n* **Standardization:** It offers a common language for describing vulnerabilities, enabling effective collaboration across different organizations and sectors.​\n* **Integration:** Many security tools and processes rely on CVE identifiers to function correctly, including vulnerability scanners, patch management systems and threat intelligence platforms.\n* **Coordination:** The program supports coordinated vulnerability disclosure, allowing vendors and researchers to manage and communicate about security issues efficiently.​\n\nWithout the CVE system, the cybersecurity community would face challenges in tracking, prioritizing and mitigating vulnerabilities, leading to increased risks and potential exploitation by threat actors.\n\n# Implications for the cybersecurity industry\n\nThe potential lapse in CVE program funding raised several concerns:​\n\n* **Operational disruption:** A halt in CVE assignments could disrupt security vendors, security teams such as Incident responders and many others, as organizations would lack standardized identifiers for new vulnerabilities.​\n* **Increased risk:** Delayed vulnerability identification and remediation efforts could expose systems to prolonged periods of risk.​\n* **Fragmentation:** In the absence of a centralized system, disparate methods for tracking vulnerabilities might emerge, leading to inconsistencies and confusion.​\n\nThese challenges underscore the critical role of the CVE program in maintaining cybersecurity resilience across industries and national infrastructures.\n\n# Strategic response and recommendations\n\nTo ensure the sustainability and effectiveness of the CVE program, the following measures are recommended:\n\n**1. Diversify funding sources**\n\nEngage stakeholders from the private sector, international partners and non-profit organizations to contribute to the program's funding, reducing reliance on a single government entity.​\n\n**2. Establish independent governance**\n\nThe formation of the CVE Foundation aims to provide a neutral, community-driven governance structure, enhancing the program's resilience and global trust.​\n\n**3. Enhance transparency**\n\nRegular communication about the program's status, funding and strategic direction can build confidence among users and contributors.​\n\n**4. Invest in automation**\n\nLeveraging automation and artificial intelligence can improve the efficiency of vulnerability identification and management processes.​\n\n**5. Strengthen international collaboration**\n\nFoster partnerships with international cybersecurity organizations to ensure a unified approach to vulnerability management and to share best practices.\n\n# European Union's proactive measures\n\nIn response to the evolving cybersecurity landscape, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) has launched the European Vulnerability Database ([EUVD](https://euvd.enisa.europa.eu/)). This initiative embraces a multi-stakeholder approach by collecting publicly available vulnerability information from multiple sources, including Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs), vendors and existing databases. The EUVD aims to enhance transparency and efficiency in vulnerability management across the EU.\n\n# Ensuring resilience and sustainability moving forward\n\nThe recent funding crisis of the CVE program highlights the fragility of essential cybersecurity infrastructures. While immediate disruptions have been averted, it is imperative for the global cybersecurity community to take proactive steps to ensure the resilience and sustainability of vulnerability management systems. Collaborative efforts, diversified funding and international cooperation will be key to safeguarding our digital ecosystems.\n\n**References:**\n\n* [MITRE Signals Potential CVE Program Deterioration as US Gov Funding Expires](https://www.securityweek.com/mitre-signals-potential-cve-program-deterioration-as-us-gov-funding-expires/)\n* [CISA Extends Funding to Ensure No Lapse in Critical CVE Services](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cisa-extends-funding-to-ensure-no-lapse-in-critical-cve-services/)\n* [Funding Expires for Key Cyber Vulnerability Database](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/04/funding-expires-for-key-cyber-vulnerability-database/)\n* [CVE Program Funding Expires—What It Means And What To Do Next](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateoflahertyuk/2025/04/16/cve-program-funding-cut-what-it-means-and-what-to-do-next/)\n* [Another Step Forward Towards Responsible Vulnerability Disclosure in Europe](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/another-step-forward-towards-responsible-vulnerability-disclosure-in-europe)\n* [ENISA Vulnerability Disclosure](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/vulnerability-disclosure)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1b9m9b9wt9ve1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7f84681c373eba979a9445cd792f306028c76ea3\n\n[This article originally appeared on the Barracuda Blog.](https://blog.barracuda.com/2025/04/16/cve-program-funding-crisis)\n\n[Adam Khan](https://blog.barracuda.com/author/adam-khan)\n\nAdam Khan is the VP, Global Security Operations at Barracuda MSP.

    "text": "\n**Apple has released an urgent update to fix two serious zero-day vulnerabilities that may have been exploited in sophisticated attacks.**\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n- Update your iPhone and other Apple devices immediately to patch critical vulnerabilities.\n- The flaws, discovered by security researchers, can allow hackers to execute remote code and bypass security protections.\n- These vulnerabilities potentially affect many Apple devices, including the latest iPhones and Macs.\n\nApple recently rolled out an emergency security update for iOS 18.4.1 in response to the discovery of two significant zero-day vulnerabilities. The first flaw, identified as CVE-2025-31200, resides within CoreAudio and allows malicious actors to execute remote code on targeted devices by sending specially crafted audio files. The second vulnerability, CVE-2025-31201, allows hackers to bypass the iOS security feature known as Pointer Authentication, exposing the device to further exploitation.\n\nThese vulnerabilities are not only concerning due to their technical nature but also because they have been linked to sophisticated attacks against well-known individuals, showing that targeted cyber threats are becoming more commonplace. While Apple has managed to patch these vulnerabilities swiftly, the existence of such flaws underlines the importance of timely software updates for all users, as attacks based on similar vulnerabilities often trickle down to the general public shortly after being discovered. Thus, ensuring that your devices are up to date is critical in maintaining security against potential exploits.\n\nHave you updated your Apple devices yet, and what steps do you take to ensure your cybersecurity?\n\n**Learn More:** [Tom's Guide](https://www.tomsguide.com/computing/online-security/apple-releases-emergency-security-update-after-extremely-sophisticated-attack-update-your-iphone-ipad-and-mac-right-now)\n\n**Want to stay updated on the latest cyber threats?** \n\n 👉 **[Subscribe to /r/PwnHub](https://www.reddit.com/r/pwnhub)**",

    "text": "\n**A recently discovered vulnerability in Cisco Webex allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on users' devices through crafted meeting invite links.**\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n- CVE-2025-20236 allows unauthenticated attackers to exploit a flaw in Webex's URL parser.\n- Users may unknowingly download malicious files by clicking on deceptive meeting links.\n- The vulnerability affects all installations of Cisco Webex App regardless of OS.\n- Immediate software updates are required as there are no workarounds.\n- Cisco has also patched other critical vulnerabilities this week.\n\nCisco recently released a security advisory regarding a significant vulnerability identified as CVE-2025-20236 in its Webex application. This issue enables unauthenticated attackers to achieve remote code execution on user devices after tricking individuals into clicking on specially crafted meeting invite links. The situation is particularly alarming as the flaw exists due to insufficient input validation in how Cisco Webex processes these links, potentially exposing users to serious security breaches without their awareness.\n\nOnce a user clicks on a malicious meeting invite, they may be led to download harmful files, enabling the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the victim's system. The implications are vast, as this vulnerability could affect companies of all sizes relying on Webex for communication. Users must apply the latest security patches provided by Cisco to safeguard their systems, as failing to do so could potentially lead to unauthorized access and exploitation of sensitive information. Furthermore, Cisco has addressed additional vulnerabilities simultaneously, underscoring the importance of maintaining updated software across all platforms.\n\nHow can organizations enhance their cybersecurity awareness to prevent falling victim to such vulnerabilities?\n\n**Learn More:** [Bleeping Computer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cisco-webex-bug-lets-hackers-gain-code-execution-via-meeting-links/)\n\n**Want to stay updated on the latest cyber threats?** \n\n 👉 **[Subscribe to /r/PwnHub](https://www.reddit.com/r/pwnhub)**",

    "text": "\n**A critical remote code execution vulnerability in SonicWall SMA VPN devices has been actively exploited since January 2025, raising concerns for organizations using these appliances.**\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n- Vulnerability CVE-2021-20035 allows remote execution of commands on SonicWall SMA VPN devices.\n- The issue impacts multiple SMA 100 series models and was first patched in September 2021.\n- Cybersecurity firm Arctic Wolf reports that attacks leveraging this flaw began as early as January 2025.\n\nThe vulnerability identified in SonicWall's Secure Mobile Access (SMA) appliances, particularly in models SMA 200, 210, 400, 410, and 500v, poses a significant threat to organizations that utilize these devices for secure remote access. Originally classified as a medium severity denial-of-service vulnerability, the flaw has been reclassified to high severity due to its potential for remote code execution, which could allow malicious actors to execute arbitrary commands with limited privileges. This change underscores the urgency for affected organizations to act swiftly to mitigate risk.\n\nCybersecurity analysts, including Arctic Wolf, have tracked the exploitation of this vulnerability since January 2025. The exploitation involves leveraging a default admin account that is widely considered insecure, which casts further doubt on the security practices of organizations using these devices. SonicWall has advised immediate action, including limiting VPN access, deactivating unnecessary accounts, enabling multi-factor authentication, and resetting all local account passwords to prevent potential breaches. Furthermore, the inclusion of this vulnerability in the CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog signals its severe implications for national security and the broad necessity for organizations to update their security measures.\n\nWhat steps have you taken to secure your VPN devices against known vulnerabilities?\n\n**Learn More:** [Bleeping Computer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/sonicwall-sma-vpn-devices-targeted-in-attacks-since-january/)\n\n**Want to stay updated on the latest cyber threats?** \n\n 👉 **[Subscribe to /r/PwnHub](https://www.reddit.com/r/pwnhub)**",

    "text": "\n**A medium-severity flaw in Windows is under active attack, allowing attackers to steal NTLM credentials through minimal user interaction.**\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n- CVE-2025-24054 exploits NTLM authentication protocol, allowing credential theft.\n- Active exploitation reported since March 19, targeting institutions in Poland and Romania.\n- Attackers use phishing campaigns to deliver malicious .library-ms files for NTLM hash extraction.\n\nThe recently identified CVE-2025-24054 vulnerability in Microsoft Windows poses a significant risk by allowing unauthorized attackers to spoof NTLM credentials across networks. NTLM is an outdated authentication protocol that has been largely deprecated in favor of newer technologies like Kerberos. However, its continued presence in Windows environments presents an enduring target for cybercriminals. This flaw can be triggered with minimal user interaction, such as a simple click or file inspection, illustrating how effortless it is for attackers to exploit it. Once activated, it can lead to the extraction of NTLM hashes, which can be further leveraged in malicious campaigns to compromise systems.\n\nFollowing the initial reports of exploitation, cybersecurity firms identified numerous campaigns, particularly targeting government and private institutions in regions like Poland and Romania. Attackers have been observed distributing malicious links via emails, using trusted cloud storage platforms to evade detection. As these malicious .library-ms files take advantage of a ZIP archive format, they facilitate an SMB authentication request, enabling hash leaks with no direct execution of the files required. This seamless method of infiltration showcases the urgency for organizations to patch these vulnerabilities promptly and address the risks associated with NTLM to safeguard their networks against credential theft and further attacks.\n\nHow can organizations better protect themselves against vulnerabilities like CVE-2025-24054 in their networks?\n\n**Learn More:** [The Hacker News](https://thehackernews.com/2025/04/cve-2025-24054-under-active.html)\n\n**Want to stay updated on the latest cyber threats?** \n\n 👉 **[Subscribe to /r/PwnHub](https://www.reddit.com/r/pwnhub)**",

This vulnerability stems from a flaw in the SSH protocol's message handling, enabling attackers to send messages prior to authentication. The flaw impacts numerous devices across telecom infrastructures, databases, and high-availability systems, drastically elevating the stakes for organizations relying on these technologies.\n\nPatch updates are available in versions 25.3.2.10 and 26.2.4, but many affected systems may face significant challenges in updating due to their entrenched positions in critical infrastructure. Researchers noted that the flaw is surprisingly easy to exploit, with multiple cybersecurity experts now having created and shared public proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits. This growing availability of exploits heightens the urgency for organizations to patch their systems swiftly, as threat actors are likely to scan for vulnerable devices imminently. Given that over 600,000 IP addresses are running Erlang/OTP, the potential for widespread compromise is considerable, particularly with targeted exploitation by state-sponsored actors becoming an ever-looming threat.\n\nWhat measures are you taking to ensure your systems are protected against this vulnerability?\n\n**Learn More:** [Bleeping Computer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/public-exploits-released-for-critical-erlang-otp-ssh-flaw-patch-now/)\n\n**Want to stay updated on the latest cyber threats?** \n\n 👉 **[Subscribe to /r/PwnHub](https://www.reddit.com/r/pwnhub)**",

This flaw has a CVSS score of 9.2 out of 10, marking it as extremely high-risk. The vulnerability stems from improper authentication controls in specific ASUS router firmware, which can be exploited by crafted requests, potentially allowing remote attackers to execute unauthorized actions on affected devices.\n\nIn response to this threat, ASUS has issued firmware updates to rectify the issue. Users with affected firmware versions, including 3.0.0.4_3823, 0.0.4_3863, 0.0.4_388, and 3.0.0.6_102, must promptly update to the latest version. Until then, users should ensure their login and Wi-Fi passwords are robust. ASUS emphasizes stronger passwords, recommending combinations of capital letters, numbers, and symbols, avoid using the same passwords across devices, and refrain from predictable patterns such as consecutive numbers or letters. Alternatively, if users are unable to apply patches immediately, disabling AiCloud and any external access services is highly recommended to reduce potential exposure.\n\nWhat steps are you taking to secure your devices against vulnerabilities like this?\n\n**Learn More:** [The Hacker News](https://thehackernews.com/2025/04/asus-confirms-critical-flaw-in-aicloud.html)\n\n**Want to stay updated on the latest cyber threats?** \n\n 👉 **[Subscribe to /r/PwnHub](https://www.reddit.com/r/pwnhub)**",

    "text": "\n**A serious vulnerability in PyTorch allows attackers to execute remote code, even when using previously recommended security measures.**\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n- CVE-2025-32434 affects all PyTorch versions up to 2.5.1.\n- Vulnerability exists in the torch.load function with weights_only=True parameter.\n- Remote code execution can happen without user interaction, posing significant risks.\n\nThe recently identified CVE-2025-32434 vulnerability in PyTorch is alarming for developers and organizations relying on machine learning frameworks. Discovered by researcher Ji'an Zhou, this security flaw enables remote code execution (RCE) when using the torch.load function with the weights_only=True parameter—a combination formerly recommended as a safe option for loading models. This contradiction in guidance puts many users at risk, as the vulnerability allows attackers to craft malicious model files that can execute arbitrary code on victim systems, potentially leading to catastrophic security breaches.\n\nThe impact of this vulnerability is particularly stark for machine learning pipelines that automatically download models from external sources or collaborative environments. With a CVSS score of 9.3, this critical vulnerability highlights how even established security measures can have unanticipated flaws. Users are urged to update to PyTorch version 2.6.0 or later to mitigate the risks or, as an interim measure, avoid using torch.load with weights_only=True. The incident underscores the importance of maintaining up-to-date dependencies in any production environment dealing with sensitive data, reminding organizations that vulnerabilities can lurk even in features designed to enhance security.\n\nHow can organizations better safeguard their machine learning pipelines against such vulnerabilities?\n\n**Learn More:** [Cyber Security News](https://cybersecuritynews.com/critical-pytorch-vulnerability/)\n\n**Want to stay updated on the latest cyber threats?** \n\n 👉 **[Subscribe to /r/PwnHub](https://www.reddit.com/r/pwnhub)**",

It resides in the me.connectify.SMJobBlessHelper helper tool, which executes system-level operations with root privileges. The security flaw arises from improper input validation in the XPC interface of this tool, allowing local attackers to inject malicious commands that the system would execute with root privileges.\n\nSpecifically, the commands can be injected through two user-controlled fields in incoming XPC messages, cmdPath and cmdBin, which are not adequately sanitized. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to local privilege escalation, allowing attackers not only to execute arbitrary commands but also to read, modify, or delete critical system files, and potentially install persistent malware.

The associated IP addresses have been linked to malware families like **XWorm**, **StrelaStealer**, and **WeaXor** ransomware.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* **Proton66** has been linked to **GootLoader**, **SpyNote**, and new ransomware campaigns like **SuperBlack**.\n* Recent campaigns are exploiting CVEs, including the **Fortinet FortiOS** vulnerabilities, primarily attributed to the **Mora\\_001** threat actor.\n* Proton66 is also hosting **malicious JavaScript** to redirect Android users to phishing sites mimicking the Google Play Store.\n* **WeaXor** ransomware (a revision of Mallox) has been seen communicating with Proton66's infrastructure.\n\n**Actionable Intel:** Organizations should block all **Proton66**\\-related IP ranges (45.135.232.0/24, 45.140.17.0/24) to neutralize potential threats and avoid interaction with this bulletproof host.\n\n**Open for Discussion:**  \nWhat are your thoughts on the increasing trend of bulletproof hosting abuse and its role in the evolution of cybercrime? Have you seen similar tactics in your threat landscape?\n\nStay vigilant and share any related intel.",

    "text": "On April 3, 2025, Gladinet disclosed a vulnerability, CVE-2025-30406 (CVSS 9.8), impacting CentreStack and Triofox servers.  \n\n \n\nThe vulnerability is a deserialization vulnerability due to the CentreStack and Triofox portal's hardcoded machineKey use. The vulnerability impacts Gladinet CentreStack through version 16.1.10296.56315 and TrioFox below version 16.4.10317.56372. \n\n \n\n**Is there active exploitation at the time of writing?**  \n\nAt the time of writing (April 21, 2025), Blackpoint’s SOC has observed exploitation of this vulnerability against versions of CentreStack, including some that are fully patched. There is an even chance the patch for CVE-2025-30406 is failing to automatically rotate machineKey’s, which leaves these applications vulnerable.  \n\n \n\nExploitation of this deserialization vulnerability provides a threat actor remote code execution against the host running CentraStack or Triofox. Threat actors are leveraging this remote execution to enumerate the targeted host and Active Directory Environment. After enumeration, the Blackpoint SOC has observed threat actors that utilize access to remotely execute malicious payloads in memory amongst the following:  \n\n* Read out /etc/hosts\n* Read out boot.ini\n* Read out configuration files\n* Enumerate domain computers, users, admins, trusts\n* Enumerate available shares\n* Enumerate current user and user’s role in domain\n* Enumerate network information\n* Enumerate running processes\n* Read out SAM Hive\n* Download and execute malicious stagers in memory \n\nThe vulnerability has been reported to be actively exploited since at least March 2025; the vulnerability was added to the U.S. CISA’s Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog on April 08, 2025. \n\n \n\n**Indicators observed:**  \n\n* portal.config\n* d27486c15c08cbd3ebe4de878995e4beae05f5f0824434a8bbf3a4c6362bf9a6\n* 92.119.197\\[.\\]3\n* c5ae011a.log.cdncache\\[.\\]rr\\[.\\]nu \n\n**Recommendations** \n\n* Immediate Action: Apply the latest CentreStack and Triofox server updates to ensure the vulnerability is patched; verify the machineKey was rotated.\n* If patching is not immediately available (or the patch did not rotate the machinekey), ensure to manually rotate the machineKey (Update machine Key). \n* Audit logs for indications of access, including logs for access to /portal/script endpoints.\n* Limit external access to CentreStack interfaces wherever possible.\n* Actively monitor for suspicious deserialization activities. ",

This makes it particularly dangerous for less tech-savvy users and internal teams not trained in threat detection.  \n  \nWhat is known:  \n\\- Affected all WhatsApp for Windows versions prior to 2.2450.6  \n\\- Exploited using specially crafted files with manipulated extensions  \n\\- Meta confirmed active exploitation before the patch was issued  \n  \nIt’s a reminder that even popular desktop apps can become threat vectors when spoofing and user trust intersect.  \nWere you or someone you know affected by this?  \nOr have you seen this exploited in the wild in an org you work with?",

The previous security patch for ECL Viewer (see [SAP note 1153794](https://me.sap.com/notes/1153794)) did not solve the vulnerability for all potential attack vectors.\n\n**Other Terms**\n\nCVE-2007-4475, US-CERT, VU#985449, CERT/CC, Secunia, SA34559  \nECL Viewer 6.0, Security, MonikerUtil_dll.dll, WebViewer3D.dll, kill bit\n\n**Reason and Prerequisites**\n\nYou have set the kill-bits as described in [SAP note 1153794](https://me.sap.com/notes/1153794), but it has been discovered that the kill-bit is not sufficient to protect against all potential attacks. Only by patching the ECL Viewer with Patch 2 will the system be protected from any other attack vectors.\n\nWe are currently not aware of a possibility to exploit any of the other attack vectors, but due to the public knowledge about this issue, it may only be a question of time until an exploitable attack vector is discovered.  \nThe vulnerability may be exploited for anonymous remote code execution.  \nIf you are using any older version of ECL Viewer, it is suggested that you upgrade to ECL Viewer 6.0 with the latest patch (Patch #2).\n\n**Solution**\n\nThis security vulnerability has been fixed with Patch 2. You can download it from the [SAP Service Marketplace](https://me.sap.com/) using the following steps:\n\n1. Visit [SAP Service Marketplace](https://me.sap.com/).\n2. Select **Support Packages and Patches**.\n3. Navigate through the following path:\n   - Supplementary Components for Cross Industry Solutions\n   - Life-Cycle Data Management\n   - ECL VIEWER\n   - ECL VIEWER 6.0\n   - Win32\n\nHere you will find Patch 2 for ECL Viewer 6.0.  \nThe patch will replace the affected DLLs with versions that include the fix for the security vulnerability.\n\n**Download Links:**\n- [Download for SNOTE](https://notesdownloads.sap.com/note/0040000016773632017)\n- [PDF Version](https://userapps.support.sap.com/sap/support/sfm/notes/print/0001329703?language=en-US&token=6FD8F32FC52CF5FC85ABB9A99C0EA339)\n\n*Credits to [RedRays](https://redrays.io) for support to provided information.*",

Until now, it was assumed that this critical vulnerability only affected the older Zen iterations (Zen 1 to Zen 4). It has now been confirmed that Ryzen and Epyc CPUs based on Zen 5 are also affected, and AMD's latest security report shows that the current Epyc 9005 (‘Turin’) series server processors, the Ryzen 9000 (‘Granite Ridge’) and Ryzen 9000X3D (‘Granite Ridge-X’) series desktop CPUs and several mobile CPUs and APUs are also at risk from the vulnerability. The firmware update closes the vulnerability and mitigates the threat.\n\n* Support for faster memory\n\nFollowing the release of the latest firmware, MSI has also included a memory kit with 192 GiByte DDR5-6000 in its compatibility list for the first time, which is made up of a total of four 48 GiByte memory modules and therefore combines high capacity with high memory speed. In the coming days, all relevant motherboard manufacturers are expected to roll out corresponding BIOS updates with AMD AGESA Combo AM5PI v1.2.0.3c. and Threadripper/Epyc derivatives.",

    "text": "\n**Recent Use-After-Free vulnerabilities in Google Chrome have been actively exploited, posing a significant security risk to users.**\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n- Multiple Use-After-Free vulnerabilities identified in Chrome's components.\n- Active exploitation allows attackers to bypass browser defenses and execute malicious code.\n- Google has implemented new protective mechanisms, but vulnerabilities remain.\n\nGoogle Chrome has encountered serious Use-After-Free (UAF) vulnerabilities that attackers are actively exploiting in the wild. These vulnerabilities arise from improper memory management, allowing potential malicious exploitation to lead to arbitrary code execution, data leakage, or denial of service. Recent CVEs such as CVE-2024-4671, CVE-2025-2476, and CVE-2025-2783 illustrate this escalating threat, with attackers using crafted HTML or malicious webpages to trick users into compromising their systems. The implications are severe, as compromised browsers can provide unauthorized access to sensitive user data and critical system resources.\n\nIn response to these threats, Google has released urgent patches and introduced new security measures like MiraclePtr, which utilizes a smart-pointer-like strategy to prevent UAF exploitation. This approach incorporates a hidden reference counter that manages memory allocations more carefully, moving potentially dangerous areas to a quarantine space. However, it's important for users to be aware that not all components are completely safeguarded, underscoring the importance of keeping Chrome updated and practicing cautious web browsing habits. Organizations should prioritize monitoring their systems for outdated versions to mitigate risks associated with these persistent vulnerabilities.\n\nHow do you think organizations can better protect themselves from such vulnerabilities in browsers?\n\n**Learn More:** [Cyber Security News](https://cybersecuritynews.com/chrome-uaf-vulnerabilities-exploited/)\n\n**Want to stay updated on the latest cyber threats?** \n\n 👉 **[Subscribe to /r/PwnHub](https://www.reddit.com/r/pwnhub)**",

    "text": "\n**Cybersecurity experts have identified DslogdRAT malware being distributed through a newly discovered zero-day vulnerability in Ivanti Connect Secure affecting organizations in Japan.**\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n- CVE-2025-0282 is a critical vulnerability in Ivanti ICS that allowed for remote code execution.\n- DslogdRAT is being used alongside other malware in targeted espionage campaigns in Japan.\n- The exploitation of this flaw has led to a significant increase in malicious scanning activity against ICS appliances.\n\nRecently, cybersecurity researchers have raised alarms about the emergence of DslogdRAT malware, which is being deployed through a critical security flaw identified as CVE-2025-0282 in Ivanti Connect Secure. This vulnerability allowed unauthorized users to execute remote code, leading to the installation of malware and a Perl web shell within targeted systems, primarily affecting organizations in Japan in late 2024. The flaw was promptly addressed by Ivanti in January 2025, but the window of opportunity for attackers had already been exploited by cyber espionage groups, particularly a group known as UNC5337.\n\nDslogdRAT establishes communication with an external server, enabling it to send system information and execute arbitrary commands. This malware is part of a wider exploitation tactic, which has also seen other malware strains such as SPAWN being deployed. Reports indicate a surge in reconnaissance activities targeting Ivanti appliances, with suspicious scanning from over 1,000 unique IP addresses in the last 90 days, potentially indicating preparations for future attacks. The implications are severe as these attacks not only threaten the confidentiality of sensitive information but also pose a risk to the integrity of critical infrastructure in affected regions.\n\nWhat steps should organizations take to protect themselves against emerging malware threats?\n\n**Learn More:** [The Hacker News](https://thehackernews.com/2025/04/dslogdrat-malware-deployed-via-ivanti.html)\n\n**Want to stay updated on the latest cyber threats?** \n\n 👉 **[Subscribe to /r/PwnHub](https://www.reddit.com/r/pwnhub)**",

Anche se per il momento non si tratta ancora di un jailbreak completo.\\\nAl momento, l’exploit permette di eseguire codice limitato sulla PlayStation 4, come script in Lua, un linguaggio di programmazione leggero.\\\nQuesto potrebbe aprire la porta a funzionalità come l’esecuzione di homebrew o, potenzialmente, l’avvio di giochi PS2 tramite emulatori. Tuttavia, non è ancora chiaro se l’exploit sia in grado di supportare l’esecuzione di backup di giochi PS4 in modo stabile.\\\nRispetto a exploit precedenti, questa vulnerabilità sembra promettente, ma non è priva di limitazioni. La tecnica basata sui salvataggi di gioco è stata utilizzata con successo su altre console, ma sulla PlayStation 4 non ha mai portato a un jailbreak completo.\\\nIntanto gli sviluppatori stanno lavorando per capire se questa scoperta possa evolversi in una soluzione più avanzata.\\\nA differenza di exploit precedenti, questa tecnica si basa su un errore di tipo double free nella funzione AIO del sistema operativo FreeBSD, che è alla base delle due console PlayStation 4 e PlayStation 5.\\\nLa vulnerabilità, correlata al CVE-2022-2390, riguarda i firmware della console PlayStation 4 dalla versione 5.0 fino alla 12.02, mentre è stata corretta nel firmware 12.50.\\\nPer console PlayStation 5, l’exploit potrebbe funzionare fino alla versione 10.60, anche se non è ancora stato confermato con certezza se sia stato risolto nel firmware 11.0.\\\nUn utente anonimo ha condiviso successivamente alcuni dump del kernel che hanno confermato la correzione della vulnerabilità nei firmware più recenti.\\\nIn seguito, il codice della patch è stato reso pubblico, e altri sviluppatori hanno confermato la validità della scoperta sui firmware precedenti.\\\n\\\nStato attuale del jailbreak\\\nSulla PlayStation 4, i metodi attualmente disponibili includono:\\\n\\\n\\\n \tJailbreak 9.0, basato su exploit WebKit ed exFAT, richiede una chiavetta USB e funziona solo fino al firmware 9.0.\\\n \tExploit PPPwn, rilasciato nel 2023, supporta firmware fino alla verisione 11.0 ma necessita di un dispositivo esterno per inviare il payload.\\\n\\\nQuesta nuova vulnerabilità potrebbe consentire un jailbreak completamente eseguibile via browser fino al firmware 9.60, eliminando la necessità di dispositivi esterni.\\\nPer firmware superiori (fino a 12.02), potrebbe essere sfruttata tramite l’exploit Lua, che però richiede un raro gioco giapponese e un salvataggio modificato, rendendolo poco accessibile.\\\nSulla PlayStation 5, la situazione appare più frammentata:\\\n\\\n\\\n \tL’exploit UMTX permette un jailbreak parziale fino al firmware 5.50 tramite browser, e fino al 7.61 utilizzando Blu-ray o Lua.\\\n \tSe confermata, la nuova vulnerabilità potrebbe estendere il jailbreak fino al firmware 10.60, potenzialmente abbinabile ad altri exploit kernel già noti (come quello di TheFlow fino al 10.40). Tuttavia, l’assenza di un exploit hypervisor limita la possibilità di ottenere un jailbreak completo.\\\n\\\nPare che la console PlayStation 4 possa beneficiare prima dei frutti di questa scoperta, grazie a una base più solida di exploit esistenti.\\\nSulla PlayStation 5 invece, la mancanza di un exploit dell'hypervisor e le possibili misure anti-Kstuff nei firmware più recenti rappresentano ostacoli significativi.\\\nFonte: x.comDiscover the best curtains shop in Dubai, where style meets quality and customization.

[CVE-2025-27610](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27610)**\n\n- 📝 Rack provides an interface for developing web applications in Ruby. Prior to versions 2.2.13, 3.0.14, and 3.1.12, `Rack::Static` can serve files under the specified `root:` even if `urls:` are provided, which may expose other files under the specified `root:` unexpectedly. The vulnerability occurs because `Rack::Static` does not properly sanitize user-supplied paths before serving files. Specifically, encoded path traversal sequences are not correctly validated, allowing attackers to access files outside the designated static file directory. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can gain access to all files under the specified `root:` directory, provided they are able to determine then path of the file. Versions 2.2.13, 3.0.14, and 3.1.12 contain a patch for the issue. Other mitigations include removing usage of `Rack::Static`, or ensuring that `root:` points at a directory path which only contains files which should be accessed publicly. It is likely that a CDN or similar static file server would also mitigate the issue.\n\n- 📅 **Published:** 10/03/2025\n- 📈 **CVSS:** 7.5\n- 🧭 **Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N\n- 📣 **Mentions:** 6\n- ⚠️ **Priority:** 2\n\n---\n\n**4.

[CVE-2025-32432](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-32432)**\n\n- 📝 Craft is a flexible, user-friendly CMS for creating custom digital experiences on the web and beyond. Starting from version 3.0.0-RC1 to before 3.9.15, 4.0.0-RC1 to before 4.14.15, and 5.0.0-RC1 to before 5.6.17, Craft is vulnerable to remote code execution. This is a high-impact, low-complexity attack vector. This issue has been patched in versions 3.9.15, 4.14.15, and 5.6.17, and is an additional fix for CVE-2023-41892.\n\n- 📅 **Published:** 25/04/2025\n- 📈 **CVSS:** 10\n- 🧭 **Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L\n- 📣 **Mentions:** 9\n- ⚠️ **Priority:** 2\n\n---\n\n**4. [CVE-2025-27610](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27610)**\n\n- 📝 Rack provides an interface for developing web applications in Ruby. Prior to versions 2.2.13, 3.0.14, and 3.1.12, `Rack::Static` can serve files under the specified `root:` even if `urls:` are provided, which may expose other files under the specified `root:` unexpectedly. The vulnerability occurs because `Rack::Static` does not properly sanitize user-supplied paths before serving files. Specifically, encoded path traversal sequences are not correctly validated, allowing attackers to access files outside the designated static file directory. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can gain access to all files under the specified `root:` directory, provided they are able to determine then path of the file. Versions 2.2.13, 3.0.14, and 3.1.12 contain a patch for the issue. Other mitigations include removing usage of `Rack::Static`, or ensuring that `root:` points at a directory path which only contains files which should be accessed publicly. It is likely that a CDN or similar static file server would also mitigate the issue.\n\n- 📅 **Published:** 10/03/2025\n- 📈 **CVSS:** 7.5\n- 🧭 **Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N\n- 📣 **Mentions:** 6\n- ⚠️ **Priority:** 2\n\n---\n\n**5. [CVE-2025-32433](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-32433)**\n\n- 📝 Erlang/OTP is a set of libraries for the Erlang programming language. Prior to versions OTP-27.3.3, OTP-26.2.5.11, and OTP-25.3.2.20, a SSH server may allow an attacker to perform unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE). By exploiting a flaw in SSH protocol message handling, a malicious actor could gain unauthorized access to affected systems and execute arbitrary commands without valid credentials. This issue is patched in versions OTP-27.3.3, OTP-26.2.5.11, and OTP-25.3.2.20.

Starting in version 7.2.0 and prior to version 7.5.2, it is possible to force an application to switch to SPA mode by adding a header to the request. If the application uses SSR and is forced to switch to SPA, this causes an error that completely corrupts the page. If a cache system is in place, this allows the response containing the error to be cached, resulting in a cache poisoning that strongly impacts the availability of the application.

    "title": "FINAL FIREWALL MIGRATION PLAN (HOPEFULLY)",
    "text": "Hello All,\n\n**TLDR** at the bottom.\n\nThis is the first time I've undertaken a firewall migration project like this so to say I'm experiencing nervousness/imposter syndrome would be an understatement (just a budding network admin that's looking at this as a right of passage)...  so any encouragement, feedback or hard truths are greatly appreciated.\n\nThat said, in preparation for a firewall migration I've been working on manually building this firewall config for a while now in Eve-NG and so far everything is working the way it should (as far as I can tell).  I think I'm just about done wrapping it up as we're nearing our deployment date so I wanted to see if there were any holes in my plan (please see [attached diagram](https://imgur.com/a/ghSQpoh)).\n\nAs you can see in the diagram we're migrating 3 Cisco ASAs (a Guest, Corporate and \"Ad Hoc\" firewall) to a single 400 series Fortigate (we'll be making it an HA pair at a later date once we get a \"breakout switch\" and a 10G expansion module for our ASR).  \n\nThe main reason for the migration is to (1) upgrade speeds from 2G to 10G and (2) to modernize our equipment.  \n\nAfter lots of research and thought I've decided to ditch the idea of VDOM/Virtual Interfaces and take the path of moving all of the interfaces from the ASAs to the Fortigate with the exception of the outside interfaces on the \"Guest\" and \"Ad Hoc\" firewalls (replaced by a single WAN interface).  I'll also be using Central SNAT and rather than using IPSec as we did on the ASAs I'll be using SSL VPN due to time and my inability to get IPsec working right (before deploying we'll be updating to a recommended FortiOS version per CVE-2024-21762, CVE-2023-27997, and CVE-2022-42475 to fix SSL vulnerabilities... i.e. 7.2.11, 7.4.7, 7.6.2, etc).\n\nSo my configuration pretty much involves copying/consolidating the following configs from the Cisco ASAs over to the Fortigate:\n\n* Interfaces: minus the two outside interfaces on the \"Guest\" and \"Ad Hoc\" firewalls\n* Zones: each interface gets it's own zone (for ease of moving ports later; also, I see no benefit to grouping interfaces for us) \n* Routing: each interface is a gateway except for two inside and one outside interface which are P2P and carry multiple subnets\n* SNAT/DNAT\n* Addresses/Groups, Services/Groups, IP Pools (only copying over what's specified in our firewall policies)\n* Firewall Policies: the only catch I had with this is the connection between the \"Ad Hoc\" firewall and the \"Corporate\" firewall as there were overlapping rules and the complication of \"Any\" rules... being that traffic to and from the \"Ad Hoc\" firewall basically has the potential to get filtered through 3 ACLs before getting out the door.\n* VPN: SSL VPN with a cert from a trusted CA on the outside and a cert from a local CA on the inside for LDAPS (MFA via MS)\n\nThe only changes I think I'll have to make on other network devices are (1) moving the two 1Gb interface configs to a single 10Gb interface (2), rerouting public IPs pointed to the P2P outside interface of the \"Guest\" firewall to the main WAN interface and (3) configuring the 10Gb interfaces on our core switch for the firewall interfaces.\n\nI'm preparing for the likelihood that issues will arise (one issue that's been brought to my attention is to clear arp cache on up/downstream interfaces... my understanding is doing a shut/no shut should fix this).\n\n**TLDR**: \n\n* How bullet proof is my plan (I intend for this deployment to pretty much be plug and play)?  \n* Given my situation how have you other network admins/engineers handled your first major project like this (and how did it turn out)?  \n* How conservative should I be with logging/features (our model has close to a TB of storage)? \n* where would you recommend placing such features/logging (my understanding according to the security assessment notifications Fortigate gives me is that logging should be on for everything)?  \n* What steps did you take during migration for deployment and assessment tests (should I only bring up one interface at a time and is there an order you would recommend)?\n\nI know I'm probably overthinking this and I also understand that not only is there no such thing as a \"one size fits all\" method but there's also no such thing as a perfectly secure network.  The way I've gone about this configuration is due to management giving me a deadline that I think I've finally pushed to it's limit.  So I just need to get everything up and functioning to the best of my ability without introducing new vulnerabilities (until I can modify the configs down the road). \n\nFYI our environment isn't mission critical/can afford downtime, only exposes VPN as well as a small handful of servers to the internet and we only have maybe 750 - 1000 devices between staff and guests connected at any given time.\n\nThanks and cheers!",

    "title": "Should I update my (very old) BIOS?",
    "text": "Hi everyone!\nIn early 2023 I built a PC from scratch by buying all the parts from Amazon/other sellers. My current setup is:\n- Gigabyte B650 Aorus Elite AX\n- Ryzen 5 7600\n- AMD RX 6750XT\n- 2x 16 GB Corsair RAM 6000 MHz (don't remember CL, but shouldn't matter right now).\n\nThe setup was smooth, everything is working fine. Let's say I'm good at following instructions.\n\nMy only issue right now is that the PC takes a little bit to boot up, more than a minute. It's not a big deal, but feels like a lot more than it would take for a modern pc running SSD.\n\nBack then I read that it was due to the early bios build.\n\nFast forward today, I somehow thought \"should I update the BIOS?\" I checked and it appears I have F1 version, released on 26/8/2022. That version is no longer even listed on the official Gigabyte download page.\n\nShould I update it? I'm not an expert, but I'm not even a complete newbie. Just to provide background I've got a MSc Degree in Computer Science Engineering and currently working in IT field. But I've never flashed a BIOS, I'm more a software guy than a hardware one, I've never worked on very low-level stuff. I've read online that the operation is recommended only if strictly required, but I've also read that it's an old thing and nowadays it's a safer operation. Also I've seen that the various BIOS versions cover at least three major security updates (Logofail, CVE-2024-36347, SMM Lock Bypass). And also implement a voltage limit on the CPU recommended by AMD.\n\nWhat would you do?",

Attackers could reconfigure industrial processes or extract sensitive data.\n\n3. Server-Side Includes (SSI) Injection (CVE-2025-24524)PiCtory’s failure to sanitize filenames allows authenticated attackers to inject malicious scripts, leading tocross-site scripting (XSS)attacks (CVSS v3.1: 9.8). This could compromise user sessions or deliver payloads to control systems.\n\nAffected Systems and Global Impact\n\nRevolution Pi devices are deployed worldwide in critical infrastructure sectors, including:\n\nKUNBUS, headquartered in Germany, has acknowledged the risks and released patches, but legacy deployments in highly regulated environments remain vulnerable due to slow update cycles.\n\nCISA and KUNBUSrecommendimmediate action to mitigate risks:\n\nKUNBUS plans to release a Cockpit plugin by April 2025 to simplify secure configurations.\n\nAdam Bromiley of Pen Test Partners discovered the vulnerabilities, which were collaboratively disclosed to CISA and KUNBUS.\n\nWhile no active exploitation has been reported, CISA emphasizes the urgency of patching, noting adversaries’ historical targeting of industrial systems for sabotage or extortion.",

    "title": "The Ultimate Guide to JWT Vulnerabilities and Attacks (with Exploitation Examples)",
    "text": "Published: 05 May 2025JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are widely used for authentication, authorization, and secure information exchange in modern web applications. They're often used in OAuth2 flows, stateless session handling, API access, and SSO implementations.A JWT consists of three parts, separated by dots:HEADER.PAYLOAD.SIGNATUREHEADER: Defines the type of token and the signing algorithm (e.g. HS256).PAYLOAD: Contains claims about the user, session, or other data (e.g. {\"user\": \"user1\", \"admin\": false}).SIGNATURE: A cryptographic signature that ensures the token hasn't been tampered with.Each part is Base64URL-encoded (without padding) and concatenated with a dot:eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.  \neyJzdWIiOiJ1c2VyMSIsImFkbWluIjpmYWxzZX0.  \nX5cBA0klC0df\\_vxTqM-M1WOUbE8Qzj0Kh3w\\_N6Y7LkI🧪 JSON Web Algorithms (JWA)The JWT specification supports multiple algorithms, defined in the JWA (JSON Web Algorithms) specification:Symmetric algorithms (HMAC based using a shared secret): HS256, HS384, HS512Asymmetric algorithms (public/private key): RS256 (RSA based), ES256 (Elliptic Curve based), PS256 (RSA based with MGF1 padding), etc.None: A non-algorithm that implies no signature (insecure and should never be used)When a token is issued, it’s signed by the issuer using the specified algorithm. The recipient must verify the signature before trusting the payload.The code to sign a token signs the concatenation of header + \".\" + payload based on the ALGORITHM picked by the developer:signature = ALGORITHM.Sign(header + \".\" + payload, key)In the same way the verification is done on header + \".\" + payload:ALGORITHM.Verify(signature, header + \".\" + payload, key)For the verification, there are multiple strategies developers can use to pick the ALGORITHM, they can hardcode it (safer) or use the value coming from the JWT header (attacker-controlled, not as safe).🔄 One Website, Many JWT ImplementationsIn modern architectures, a single web application can be composed of dozens of microservices. Even if they share a hostname, each service may:Use a different JWT libraryUse a different signing key or verification logicParse and validate tokens differentlyThis means every endpoint must be tested individually. Don’t assume that if the login or main API endpoint handles JWT securely, all others do too. A misconfigured service or third-party microservice might still be vulnerable.Throughout this guide, we’ll cover the most common — and most dangerous — JWT implementation flaws, how they are exploited, and how to detect or defend against them. Each section links to PentesterLab exercises so you can practice the attacks in a hands-on environment.🔓 1. Signature Not VerifiedOne of the most common and dangerous implementation mistakes when using JWTs is failing to verify the signature. JWTs are not encrypted — their purpose is to provide integrity. This means the contents of the token can be viewed by anyone, but should not be trusted unless the signature has been verified.Unfortunately, some applications skip this critical step. This often happens because developers use a library’s decode() method instead of verify(), or they temporarily disable signature verification during testing and forget to re-enable it.ExploitationIf a JWT is not verified before use, an attacker can forge arbitrary claims. The steps are trivial:Obtain a valid token (e.g., by registering or logging in as a normal user).Base64URL-decode the token to view the header and payload.Modify the payload, for example changing:{\"user\": \"bob\", \"role\": \"user\"}  \nto:{\"user\": \"admin\", \"role\": \"admin\"}  \n  \nBase64URL-encode the modified header and payload.Reassemble the token. You can:Keep the original signature (most likely to work), or  \nRemove it completely and just send header.payload. (less likely to work)  \n  \nSend the token in a request (e.g., as a cookie or Authorization header).If the server does not verify the signature, it will treat the forged claims as valid — and you’ll be authenticated as admin.Even experienced developers can make this mistake when trying to quickly inspect a token’s contents or during local testing.ImpactThis issue can lead to:Authentication bypassAuthorization bypassThis issue effectively renders JWT-based authentication useless if not properly handled.MitigationsAlways use a library’s verify() method before accessing claims.Never trust the payload until the signature is successfully validated.Add integration tests that verify signature enforcement across all endpoints.Use code reviews and static analysis to detect misuse of decode() or insecure JWT flows.Practice It 🧪You can try this exact attack in a hands-on lab:👉 PentesterLab: JWT Without Signature Verification❌ 2. None Algorithm AttackThe JWT specification allows tokens to specify the signing algorithm in their header using the \"alg\" field. Early versions of many JWT libraries accepted None or none as a valid option, meaning the token was considered valid without a signature at all. This was mostly due to developers of the library following the JWT specification and implementing all the required algorithms.This was originally intended for debugging or unsecured flows, but in practice, it opened a serious security hole when libraries did not explicitly disable or reject the none algorithm.ExploitationTo exploit a JWT implementation that allows \"none\":Obtain a valid token (e.g., login as a normal user).Base64URL-decode the JWT and modify the header:{\"alg\": \"HS256\", \"typ\": \"JWT\"}  \nbecomes:{\"alg\": \"none\", \"typ\": \"JWT\"}  \nor{\"alg\": \"None\", \"typ\": \"JWT\"}  \n  \nModify the payload to escalate privileges:{\"user\": \"admin\"}  \n  \nBase64URL-encode the new header and payload.Assemble the token with an empty signature part:base64url(header) + \".\" + base64url(payload) + \".\"  \n  \nSend the token to the application.If the backend does not reject tokens with \"alg\": \"none\", it will accept this token as valid — and you’re now admin without any cryptographic proof.ImpactThis issue can lead to:Authentication bypassAuthorization bypassThis issue effectively renders JWT-based authentication useless if not properly handled.MitigationsExplicitly disable the \"none\" algorithm in your JWT library [configuration.Do](http://configuration.Do) not rely on defaults, enforce algorithm allowlists like RS256 or HS256.Reject tokens that contain \"alg\": \"none\" at the parser level.Consider validating the algorithm independently from the token itself.Practice It 🧪Try this vulnerability in a hands-on lab:👉 PentesterLab: JWT None Algorithm🧂 3. Trivial Secret (Weak HMAC Keys)When using HMAC-based algorithms like HS256, the integrity of the JWT depends entirely on the secrecy and strength of the shared secret key. If the key is weak, guessable, or hardcoded, an attacker can brute-force it using a known JWT and use it to forge arbitrary tokens.This vulnerability can be common in poorly secured APIs and test environments, and it often affects production systems due to careless key management.ExploitationThe attacker needs just one valid token. With that, they can run an offline brute-force attack to recover the secret. Here's how:Capture a valid JWT from the application.Split it into the three parts: header.payload.signature.Use a tool like Hashcat, or a custom script to brute-force the shared secret by computing:HMAC(secret, base64url(header) + \".\" + base64url(payload)) == signature  \n  \nOnce the secret is found, modify the payload (e.g., escalate role or spoof another user).Re-sign the token using the cracked secret and send it to the application.This entire attack can be performed offline, without generating noise or alerts on the target system.Common weak secrets include:\"secret\"\"123456\"Service or project names (e.g., \"my-api\")Hardcoded defaults in open-source projectsYou can use a list of known JWT secrets like wallarm/jwt-secrets to increase your chance of recovering the secret.MitigationUse cryptographically strong secrets for HMAC algorithms (e.g., 32+ random bytes).Never hardcode secrets in source code or config files.Rotate secrets periodically and use environment-specific [secrets.Support](http://secrets.Support) for multiple secrets to enable rotation.Log and monitor token validation errors.Practice It 🧪Try this attack in a hands-on environment with a weak secret you can crack yourself:👉 PentesterLab: JWT Trivial Secret🔀 4. Algorithm Confusion (RSA to HMAC)One of the most subtle, yet devastating, JWT vulnerabilities arises from algorithm confusion. This attack exploits the fact that the JWT header includes a user-controlled \"alg\" parameter. If the server doesn’t enforce which algorithm is expected, an attacker can manipulate the header to cause the backend to verify the token using the wrong algorithm — often with catastrophic consequences.The most common variant: swapping an RS256 (RSA) token to HS256 (HMAC), and then using the RSA public key (meant only for verification) as the HMAC secret.ExploitationThis attack works because of how asymmetric (RSA) and symmetric (HMAC) algorithms function:RSA (RS256): The server signs with its private key and verifies with its public key.HMAC (HS256): The same secret is used for both signing and verification.If the server trusts the \"alg\" field from the token header and uses the public key as the HMAC secret, an attacker can:Obtain a valid JWT signed with RSA.Base64URL-decode the token and change the header from:{\"alg\": \"RS256\", \"typ\": \"JWT\"}  \nto:{\"alg\": \"HS256\", \"typ\": \"JWT\"}  \n  \nModify the payload (e.g., change user role or identity).Sign the new header.payload using HMAC with the server’s RSA public key.Send the forged token.If the server blindly uses HS256 and its public key as the HMAC secret, the forged token will validate — and the attacker can fully impersonate any user.How to Get the Public KeyThere are many ways to get access to the public key:Sometimes embedded in frontend JavaScriptHardcoded in mobile appsPublished in documentation or well-known JWK endpointsRecovered from ECDSA signatures or multiple RSA signatures using tools such as rsa\\_sign2nImpactThis issue can lead to:Authentication bypassAuthorization bypassMitigationNever trust the \"alg\" field from the JWT itself.Enforce the expected algorithm at the configuration level (e.g., alg = RS256 only).Separate token parsing from verification logic — and never auto-select algorithms.Use libraries that do not allow dynamic algorithm switching or require explicit key types.Practice It 🧪Try this exact attack by forging a token using the public key as the HMAC secret:👉 PentesterLab: JWT Algorithm Confusion and PentesterLab: JWT Algorithm Confusion with RSA Public Key Recovery🔀 4b. Algorithm Confusion (ECDSA to HMAC)This variation of the algorithm confusion attack targets applications using ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm), for example ES256. Just like the RSA-to-HMAC confusion, the core issue is that the application trusts the \"alg\" field from the JWT header, and uses it to select the verification method and key type dynamically.By changing the \"alg\" field from ES256 (ECDSA) to HS256 (HMAC), an attacker can trick the server into verifying the token using an HMAC signature — and use the ECDSA public key as the HMAC secret.ExploitationHere’s how the attack works:Obtain a valid JWT signed using ES256 (ECDSA).Modify the token:Change \"alg\": \"ES256\" to \"alg\": \"HS256\" in the header.  \nModify the payload (e.g., set \"user\": \"admin\").  \nBase64URL-encode the new header and payload.  \n  \nSign the header.payload using HMAC and the public ECDSA key as the secret.Send the forged token to the server.If the backend is vulnerable and uses the public key as a secret without validating the key type or the original algorithm, the forged HMAC will validate — and the attacker gains access with elevated privileges.Why This WorksECDSA is asymmetric: it uses a private key to sign and a public key to verify.HMAC is symmetric: it uses the same secret key to sign and verify.If a system allows switching from ECDSA to HMAC, and treats the public key as a secret (because it’s all it has access to), it creates an unsafe equivalence between asymmetric and symmetric cryptography — and the attacker takes full advantage of this confusion.Recovering the Public KeyAs with RSA, you can find the key in documentation, SDK or in mobile apps. Alternatively, you can programmatically recover two potential public keys from a signature. You can find more details and code to recover the ECDSA public keys in our blog: Algorithm Confusion Attacks against JWT using ECDSA.ImpactThis issue can lead to:Authentication bypassAuthorization bypassMitigationNever trust the \"alg\" field in the JWT header.Enforce algorithms server-side (e.g., alg = ES256 only).Do not allow clients to specify algorithms dynamically.Use libraries that reject unknown or unsupported algorithm types.Practice It 🧪Try this attack in a lab that walks you through recovering the ECDSA public key and forging a JWT using HMAC:👉 PentesterLab: JWT Algorithm Confusion with ECDSA Public Key Recovery🪤 5. kid Injection (Key ID Manipulation)The JWT header supports a field called \"kid\" — short for Key ID. This field allows the token to indicate which key should be used to verify the signature. It is especially useful in systems with key rotation or multiple signing keys.However, when applications dynamically fetch keys based on this field — especially from filesystems or databases — the kid value becomes a dangerous injection point. If the application uses it insecurely (e.g., directly concatenating it into a file path or SQL query), attackers can manipulate it to point to keys they control or leak internal secrets.Exploitation: Path TraversalIn file-based key lookups, the application might do something like:key\\_path = \"/keys/\" + kid  \npublic\\_key = readFile(key\\_path)An attacker can supply a JWT with:\"kid\": \"../../../../dev/null\"This results in:/keys/../../../../dev/null → /dev/nullSince reading from /dev/null will return an empty string, an attacker can forge a token and sign it with an empty string.Exploitation: SQL InjectionIf the application loads keys from a database using an unsafe query:SELECT key FROM keys WHERE kid = ''The attacker can supply:\"kid\": \"zzzz' UNION SELECT '123' --\"This causes the application to fetch and use an attacker-supplied value (123), which will successfully verify forged JWTs signed with the matching private key.ImpactThis issue can lead to:Authentication bypassAuthorization bypassRemote command executionSQL InjectionMitigationValidate kid strictly — never allow user-controlled paths or queries.Use allowlists of valid kid values with fixed file or key mappings.Sanitize and canonicalize paths before use.Use parameterized queries if accessing a database.Log and monitor invalid or unexpected kid values.Practice It 🧪Practice injecting a malicious kid to control key selection and forge tokens:👉 PentesterLab: JWT kid Injection and Directory Traversal👉 PentesterLab: JWT kid Injection and RCE👉 PentesterLab: JWT kid Injection and SQL Injection🧬 6. Embedded JWK (CVE-2018-0114)JWTs can optionally include a JWK (JSON Web Key) directly inside the token header using the jwk parameter. This is intended to allow token issuers to specify the public key that should be used to verify the token — particularly useful in distributed systems or rotating key setups.However, if the server accepts any public key supplied in the token without proper validation (such as checking the issuer, key origin, or intended usage), an attacker can embed their own public key into the header and generate tokens that validate against it.This vulnerability was publicly disclosed as CVE-2018-0114 and affected the popular PyJWT library. It allowed attackers to bypass authentication by embedding their key and signing tokens with the matching private key.ExploitationTo exploit this vulnerability, the attacker:Generates their own RSA key pair.Creates a JWT with a forged payload (e.g., \"user\": \"admin\").Includes their public key in the header under the jwk field:\"jwk\": {  \n  \"kty\": \"RSA\",  \n  \"e\": \"AQAB\",  \n  \"n\": \"...\"  \n}  \n  \nSigns the token using their private key.Sends the token to the vulnerable service.If the application naively uses the JWK from the token header, the attacker’s key is used to verify the token — making the forged token appear legitimate.ImpactThis issue can lead to:Authentication bypassAuthorization bypassMitigationNever accept keys from the token itself.If using a JWK from the header, validate:Its issuer  \nIts source (is it known/trusted?)  \nIts purpose (e.g., ensure \"use\": \"sig\" and not \"enc\")  \n  \nDisable jwk header parsing unless explicitly needed.Upgrade any libraries affected by CVE-2018-0114.Practice It 🧪Try forging a JWT using your own key and bypass verification using the embedded jwk:👉 PentesterLab: CVE-2018-0114🌐 7. JKU / X5U Header AbuseJWT supports additional headers like jku (JWK Set URL) and x5u (X.509 certificate URL) that point to external URLs where public keys can be retrieved. These fields are designed to help recipients dynamically fetch verification keys, especially in distributed or federated systems.However, if the application does not strictly control the source of these URLs, it opens the door for Server-Side Request Forgery and using an attacker-controlled key. An attacker can host their own key set or certificate and sign tokens with their private key, then instruct the server (via jku or x5u) to download and trust that key.ExploitationTo exploit this behavior, an attacker will:Generate their own RSA key [pair.Host](http://pair.Host) the public key on a server they control, either:As a JWK set (for jku)  \nAs an X.509 certificate (for x5u)  \n  \nCreate a JWT with:\"alg\": \"RS256\"  \n\"jku\": \"https://attacker.com/jwks.json\" or \"x5u\": \"https://attacker.com/cert.pem\"  \n  \nSign the token using their private key.Send the forged token to the target application.If the server accepts the remote key without validation, it will trust the token — because it successfully verifies with the attacker’s hosted key.This attack can also be exploited by leveraging a file upload, header injection or open redirectImpactThis issue can lead to:Authentication bypassAuthorization bypassServer-Side Request ForgeryMitigationDo not trust keys from arbitrary jku or x5u URLs.Implement an explicit allowlist of trusted domains for JWK and cert loading.Validate that the key downloaded from the remote URL matches expected kid values.Log and alert on unexpected external JWK or cert URLs.Prefer local key storage unless dynamic remote keys are absolutely necessary.Practice It 🧪Practice forging a token that the server will trust based on the jku or x5u field:👉 PentesterLab: JWT JKU attacks👉 PentesterLab: JWT JKU and File Upload👉 PentesterLab: JWT JKU and Open Redirect👉 PentesterLab: JWT JKU and Header Injection👉 PentesterLab: JWT JKU Injection🧙 8. CVE-2022-21449 (Psychic Signature)In 2022, a critical vulnerability was discovered in the Java JDK’s ECDSA signature verification implementation. This bug, now known as the “Psychic Signature” vulnerability — allowed attackers to bypass digital signature verification entirely by submitting an invalid signature where both values (s and r) are set to zero.Tracked as CVE-2022-21449, this bug impacted applications that used Java’s java.security.Signature class to verify ECDSA-signed JWTs, especially when using algorithms like ES256.ExploitationThe core of the vulnerability is that the Java implementation incorrectly accepted the signature with r=0 and s=0 as valid, even though these values should never occur in legitimate ECDSA signatures.To exploit the issue:Generate any JWT with \"alg\": \"ES256\" and a forged payload (e.g., \"user\": \"admin\").Base64URL-encode the header and payload.Append a forged signature consisting of r=0 and s=0: (Base64URL-encoded: MAYCAQACAQA)Send the JWT to the target Java-based service.If the backend uses a vulnerable version of Java and ECDSA verification, it will accept the forged token as valid — bypassing all authentication and allowing privilege escalation.Why This HappensECDSA signatures are composed of two integers: r and s.Java’s signature verification logic failed to reject values when both r = 0 and s = 0.Since these values were not checked properly, any JWT could be “valid” when signed with a zeroed signature.ImpactThis issue can lead to:Authentication bypassAuthorization bypassMitigationUpgrade to a patched version of Java (JDK 17.0.3+, 11.0.15+, 8u331+, etc.).Avoid using ECDSA signatures if your cryptographic library is untrusted or poorly maintained.Reject tokens with suspicious or malformed signatures — especially all-zero signatures.Write test cases that attempt to validate known-invalid JWTs.Practice It 🧪Practice crafting a forged JWT using a zeroed signature to bypass verification:👉 PentesterLab: JWT Psychic Signature aka CVE-2022-21449📚 Final Thoughts: Mastering JWT SecurityJWTs are powerful tools for stateless authentication, but they come with a complex and subtle attack surface. As you've seen throughout this guide, the most devastating JWT vulnerabilities often stem from small misconfigurations, incorrect assumptions, or over-trusting user-controlled data.And the danger is compounded in modern architectures: a single application might use JWTs in dozens of different places — APIs, microservices, SSO layers, mobile backends — all with potentially different libraries, configs, and logic.If you're auditing or pentesting an app:Test every endpoint individuallyCheck for discrepancies in JWT parsing and verificationDon’t assume one secure implementation covers the entire systemIf you're a developer or security engineer:Never trust JWT headers blindly (especially alg, kid, jku, x5u, and jwk)Use proven libraries and keep them up-to-dateEnforce strict configuration and avoid dynamic behaviors unless absolutely necessary🎯 Reading Isn’t Enough — You Have to PracticeIt’s one thing to understand an attack in theory — but another to pull it off under real-world constraints.

A race condition exists in the AWS4-HMAC (compatible with S3) authorization method of the HTTP component of the FTP server. The server first verifies the existence of the user by performing a call to login_user_pass() with no password requirement. This will authenticate the session through the HMAC verification process and up until the server checks for user verification once more. The vulnerability can be further stabilized, eliminating the need for successfully triggering a race condition, by sending a mangled AWS4-HMAC header. By providing only the username and a following slash (/), the server will successfully find a username, which triggers the successful anypass authentication process, but the server will fail to find the expected SignedHeaders entry, resulting in an index-out-of-bounds error that stops the code from reaching the session cleanup. Together, these issues make it trivial to authenticate as any known or guessable user (e.g., crushadmin), and can lead to a full compromise of the system by obtaining an administrative account.\n\n- 📅 **Published:** 03/04/2025\n- 📈 **CVSS:** 9.8\n- 🧭 **Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\n- 📣 **Mentions:** 59\n- ⚠️ **Priority:** 2\n\n---\n\n**2.

If you like articles like this, consider subscribing to the [**MCPJam newsletter**](https://mcpjam.substack.com/) for news and learnings on MCPs! \n\n# Critical Vulnerability in workers-oauth-provider\n\nIn today’s article we wanted to make sure people were aware of [CVE-2025-4143](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4143). This is an OAuth vulnerability in the workers-oauth-provider package released by Cloudflare. For those of you using Cloudflare’s deployments for remote servers you might have set up [authorization](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/model-context-protocol/authorization/) based on their tutorials. In these they use [mcp-remote](https://github.com/geelen/mcp-remote) and [workers-oauth-provider](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider) to implement the client and server roles of an OAuth initialization respectively.\n\nThe vulnerability in the package is that there is no validation for redirect URIs - commonly known as open redirect. Whether this was exploitable on your application depends on the implementation. If the application automatically approved previously authorized clients, and did not implement a redirect URI check, then this vulnerability was exploitable. \n\nTo illustrate the vulnerability, assume that a user was authorized on `http://mcpserver.com/mcp`which later automatically approves previously authorized clients. If the same user used a link such as [`http://mcpserver.com/mcp?url=http://maliciousserver.com`](http://mcpserver.com/mcp?url=http://maliciousserver.com) this might cause the application to automatically approve their request, and send credentials to `http://maliciousserver.com`. \n\nThis meant that whoever controlled [`http://maliciousserver.com`](http://maliciousserver.com) could finish the OAuth flow and gain credentials to the application as the user.\n\nThis has now been fixed in the latest update of workers-oauth-provider so if you’re using this package, and have a similar application setup, make sure to update the package version, and validate redirect URIs.\n\n  \n",

While the breach vector has not been disclosed, it was revealed that endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions were not in place at the time, highlighting the need for proactive cybersecurity measures. Tools such as tabletop exercises and penetration testing are strongly recommended to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities before they are exploited.\n\n**CVE-2025-24054**\n\nSeparately, CVE-2025-24054 has emerged as a critical Windows vulnerability involving .library-ms files. Delivered via phishing emails, these files can trigger a system’s NTLM hash to be sent to a malicious server upon interaction—without being opened, allowing attackers to escalate privileges and move laterally within a network. Mitigation includes blocking external SMB connections, transitioning from NTLM to Kerberos, and enhancing phishing awareness training.\n\n**Workaround for CVE-2025-21204**\n\nAdditionally, a workaround for CVE-2025-21204, intended to enable Windows updates, has introduced a new issue where symbolic links created by non-admin users can prevent future updates. Although Microsoft has classified this as a medium-severity concern, organizations should monitor for potential exploitation.\n\n**DragonForce**\n\nLastly, the ransomware group DragonForce has launched a white-label ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) platform, reducing the technical burden for affiliates and allowing them to brand attacks independently. This development could significantly broaden participation in ransomware activity and heighten the threat landscape.",

    "text": "I wanted to make a single landing spot for consumers with an overview of AirBorne that explains and links to what it is, what it means for consumers, and what can be done to mitigate it - including the status of third party devices and firmware fixes.\n\n# What Is Airborne?\n\nThe TLDR is, it's bad news, and can be used by hackers to pwn u. Take it seriously.\n\nOn April 29, 2025, [Oligo Security Research publicly announced](https://www.oligo.security/blog/airborne)  that they had discovered multiple vulnerabilities that can be leveraged for pretty serious attack vectors including RCE (Remote Code Execution) on Apple hardware and  devices using the Apple AirPlay SDK (this includes third party devices!). Fortunately, Oligo is a good player who worked with Apple ahead of time, which let Apple release with fixes before Oligo announced to the public and submitting public CVEs. For more news and context read:\n\n* [Wired: Millions of Apple Airplay-Enabled Devices Can Be Hacked via Wi-Fi](https://www.wired.com/story/airborne-airplay-flaws/)\n* [AppleInsider: Hackers could hijack AirPlay & CarPlay devices using set of 'Airborne' flaws](https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/04/29/hackers-could-hijack-airplay-carplay-devices-using-set-of-airborne-flaws?utm_medium=rss)\n* [Apple security releases](https://support.apple.com/en-us/100100)\n\n# How Can I Protect Myself?\n\nI'm going to break this into a three pronged approach that you should take to protect yourself.\n\n# 1) Upgrade your Apple Systems\n\nThe most important, and likely the easiest mitigation (it's probably already be done if you have auto-updates turned on) is to make sure all your Apple devices are OS versions that have been patched. For modern gear, the latest available OS is good. To see specific versions for macOS/iPadOS/iOS/watchOS/tvOS/visionOS that have the patches, look at the [Oligo announcement](https://www.oligo.security/blog/airborne) or the individual NIST CVE records:\n\n* [CVE-2025-24206](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-24206)\n* [CVE-2025-24271](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-24271)\n* [CVE-2025-24271](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-24271)\n* [CVE-2025-24132](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-24132)\n* [CVE-2025-30422](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-30422)\n* [CVE-2025-24252](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-24252)\n* [CVE-2025-24137](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-24137)\n* [CVE-2025-31197](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-31197)\n* [CVE-2025-24270](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-24270)\n\nTLDR - Make sure your Apple devices are running at least  macOS Sequoia 15.4, tvOS 18.4, macOS Ventura 13.7.5, iPadOS 17.7.6, macOS Sonoma 14.7.5, iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4, visionOS 2.4, watchOS 11.3\n\n# 2) Prevent access to your network by hackers or exploited devices\n\nSounds simple, but this is an entire field of study with a resulting industry and many, often competing, paradigms & approaches that can be used to mitigate - so I'm just going to give a little bit of advice on here. If you have anything that you don't trust completely, do not allow it on your primary network. This could be friends devices, weird IoT things you bought online, frankly I treat everything that doesn't \\*have\\* to be on my main network as questionable. This doesn't mean you cannot or should not use them though. I personally use a Ubiquiti UniFi system that allows creating \"Zones\" which are then implemented as separate VLANs and SSIDs, which allow me to create isolated networks for IoT devices and Guests, which I can gate access both from my primary network, as well as to the Internet. UniFi offers excellent visibility into watching what flows these devices attempt, and the ability to cut them off, or whitelist only the ones you have identified as being reasonable. You can also enable device isolation, which prevents IoT devices from speaking to each other, even on the same network. This is the easiest way I have found to balance the convenience of having devices I don't \"fully\" trust, while not being a hermit living in a faraday cage with everything air gapped :)  If you're not a Ubiquiti user, you can do this manually with VLANs and firewalls, but managing VLANs and firewalls can get tedious and complex if it's not centralized (which is what UniFi does). If you know, you know. If you don't, I recommend UniFi, but there are alternatives.\n\nYou should be doing this regardless, Airborne is just one example of many that has come or will come. Proper network isolation will also prevent exploits from misconfiguration, non-public exploits, or even bad actor device manufacturers.\n\n# 3) Secure Peer-to-Peer AirPlay\nAir-to-Air AirPlay his is a feature available on Macs, iPads, iPhones and Apple TVs. It uses Bluetooth for discovery & negotiation, which sets up an ad-hoc WiFi connection, which is used for AirPlay. If you have an affected device that cannot be updated to a safe firmware, you should disable Peer-to-Peer AirPlay, or at least lock it down so it is not open for everyone to access. Here's how:\n- Mac - Settings -> General -> AirDrop & Handoff -> AirPlay Receiver\n- iPhone/iPad - Settings -> General -> AirPlay & Continuity -> AirPlay Receiver\n- AppleTV - Settings -> AirPlay & HomeKit -> Peer-to-Peer Wireless\n\n# 4) Update software & patch devices made with AirPlay & CarPlay SDKs\n\nFor some of us, this is going to be the hardest one, with the longest tail. Software and device firmware built with official Apple versions prior to AirPlay audio SDK 2.7.1, AirPlay video SDK 3.6.0.126 and CarPlay Communication Plug-in R18.1 are also vulnerable - even if they are running on OS's that are patched. These are going to have to be tracked individually, as each manufacturer will have to release their own updates. I'm going to add a list here that gives us a spot to centrally track state and status of various third party accessories. Feel free to add a device and I can integrate it with this main list.\n\n## Airplay / CarPlay Devices\n| **AirPlay Audio** | |\n|:-|:-|\n| Apple Airport Express | While over 500 people have signed [the change.org petition to encourage Apple to fix](https://www.change.org/p/encourage-apple-to-resume-firmware-updates-for-airport-express-security-environment) it, the last firmware update was 2019, and the device was released in 2012. I hate to say it, but it's a long shot this will be fixed. |\n| Arylic | I can find no record of Arylic acknowledging Airborne |\n| Eve Play | I can find no record of Eve acknowledging Airborne |\n| Shareport-Sync | Popular Linux software which can act as an AirPlay server, and is used by many other apps/distributions like balenaSound & Volumio. [According to the maintainer they are not affected](https://github.com/mikebrady/shairport-sync/discussions/2019#discussioncomment-12998767), as the vulnerabilities are in the Apple SDKs and are not protocol level. |\n| Sonos | I can find no record of Sonos acknowledging Airborne |\n| WiiM | [WiiM has acknowledged the issue in this forum post](https://forum.wiimhome.com/threads/%E2%80%9Emillions-of-apple-airplay-enabled-devices-can-be-hacked-via-wi-fi%E2%80%9C.7075/post-124465), but there are no fixes or plans announced yet. |\n\nAirPlay Video is going to incluce Roku and various smart TV manufacturers, which would be a tedious list to maintain. If we identify any manufacturers who either have acknowledged, have updated, or have stated that they will not update, then we can add them here. But attempting to list all manufacturers/models possible would be too long.\n\nCarPlay similarly is going to include a huge list of auto OEMs, head unit manufacturers, and possibly (?) even third party devices like CarPlay WiFi adapters. Instead, we can call out any manufacturers who have acknowledged, fixed, or stated they will not fix.",

[CVE-2025-31161](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-31161)**\n\n- 📝 CrushFTP 10 before 10.8.4 and 11 before 11.3.1 allows authentication bypass and takeover of the crushadmin account (unless a DMZ proxy instance is used), as exploited in the wild in March and April 2025, aka Unauthenticated HTTP(S) port access. A race condition exists in the AWS4-HMAC (compatible with S3) authorization method of the HTTP component of the FTP server. The server first verifies the existence of the user by performing a call to login_user_pass() with no password requirement. This will authenticate the session through the HMAC verification process and up until the server checks for user verification once more. The vulnerability can be further stabilized, eliminating the need for successfully triggering a race condition, by sending a mangled AWS4-HMAC header. By providing only the username and a following slash (/), the server will successfully find a username, which triggers the successful anypass authentication process, but the server will fail to find the expected SignedHeaders entry, resulting in an index-out-of-bounds error that stops the code from reaching the session cleanup. Together, these issues make it trivial to authenticate as any known or guessable user (e.g., crushadmin), and can lead to a full compromise of the system by obtaining an administrative account.\n\n- 📅 **Published:** 03/04/2025\n- 📈 **CVSS:** 9.8\n- 🧭 **Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\n- 📣 **Mentions:** 59\n- ⚠️ **Priority:** 2\n\n---\n\n**2.

    "title": "Critical Vulnerability in AI Builder Langflow Under Attack",
    "text": "\n**A severe vulnerability in the AI development tool Langflow is being actively exploited by attackers, prompting urgent security alerts from CISA.**\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n- CISA warns of critical-severity vulnerability CVE-2025-3248 affecting Langflow.\n- Attackers can execute arbitrary code remotely on vulnerable systems.\n- The vulnerability has been present in Langflow versions prior to 1.3.0 for two years.\n- Patches are required before May 26, with priority suggested for federal agencies.\n\nLangflow, a low-code AI builder, is facing significant security risks due to a critical vulnerability tracked as CVE-2025-3248, which boasts a CVSS score of 9.8. The flaw, identified in a code validation endpoint, allows unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by sending specially crafted HTTP requests. This serious oversight has raised alarms within the cybersecurity community, especially after proof-of-concept exploit code for the vulnerability was publicly released, underscoring the urgency for organizations to secure their installations against potential breaches.\n\nThe vulnerability has been present in Langflow versions dating back two years, affecting numerous installations around the globe. CISA has added this vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog, emphasizing that all federal agencies must apply necessary patches by the approaching deadline of May 26. Unfortunately, the fix provided in version 1.3.0 does not fully eliminate risks, as it still allows for privilege escalation within the framework. Organizations are urged to restrict network access to eliminate exposure and reduce the likelihood of exploitation. Given that security firms have reported a spike in detections of attacks aimed at this vulnerability, the disregard for timely updates could have devastating consequences.\n\nHow can organizations better prioritize security updates to protect themselves from emerging vulnerabilities like this one?\n\n**Learn More:** [Security Week](https://www.securityweek.com/critical-vulnerability-in-ai-builder-langflow-under-attack/)\n\n**Want to stay updated on the latest cyber threats?** \n\n 👉 **[Subscribe to /r/PwnHub](https://www.reddit.com/r/pwnhub)**",

    "title": "How to get the UTF-8 Byte Width and Validate the byte sequence.",
    "text": "A UTF-8 byte sequence is variable in length and may be in the range of 1 to 4 bytes.\n\nGet the UTF-8 Byte Width:\n\n```c\nint8_t utf8_byte_width(const uint8_t* start) {\n    // Check if the input pointer is NULL\n    if (!start) {\n        return -1;\n    }\n\n    // Get the lead byte from the start of the UTF-8 character\n    uint8_t lead_byte = *start;\n\n    // Check if the lead byte is a 1-byte UTF-8 character (ASCII range)\n    if ((lead_byte & 0x80) == 0x00) {\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    // Check if the lead byte is a 2-byte UTF-8 character\n    else if ((lead_byte & 0xE0) == 0xC0) {\n        return 2;\n    }\n\n    // Check if the lead byte is a 3-byte UTF-8 character\n    else if ((lead_byte & 0xF0) == 0xE0) {\n        return 3;\n    }\n\n    // Check if the lead byte is a 4-byte UTF-8 character\n    else if ((lead_byte & 0xF8) == 0xF0) {\n        return 4;\n    }\n\n    // Return -1 if the lead byte is invalid\n    return -1; \n}\n```\n\nValidating the sequence is more of a challenge. But with some bitwise magic, we can get it done.\n\n```c\nbool utf8_byte_is_valid(const uint8_t* start) {\n    // Check if the input pointer is NULL\n    if (!start) {\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    // Get the width of the UTF-8 character starting at 'start'\n    int8_t width = utf8_byte_width(start);\n    if (width == -1) {\n        return false; // Early exit if the width is invalid\n    }\n\n    // ASCII (1-byte) characters are always valid, except if they are continuation bytes\n    if (width == 1) {\n        // Reject continuation bytes as standalone sequences\n        if ((start[0] & 0xC0) == 0x80) {\n            return false;\n        }\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    // Validate continuation bytes for multi-byte characters\n    for (int8_t i = 1; i < width; i++) {\n        if ((start[i] & 0xC0) != 0x80) {\n            return false; // Invalid continuation byte\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Additional checks for overlongs, surrogates, and invalid ranges\n    if (width == 2) {\n        if (start[0] < 0xC2) {\n            return false; // Overlong encoding\n        }\n    } else if (width == 3) {\n        if (start[0] == 0xE0 && start[1] < 0xA0) {\n            return false; // Overlong encoding\n        }\n        if (start[0] == 0xED && start[1] >= 0xA0) {\n            return false; // Surrogate halves\n        }\n    } else if (width == 4) {\n        if (start[0] == 0xF0 && start[1] < 0x90) {\n            return false; // Overlong encoding\n        }\n        if (start[0] == 0xF4 && start[1] > 0x8F) {\n            return false; // Above U+10FFFF\n        }\n    }\n\n    // If all checks passed, the character is valid\n    return true;\n}\n```\n\nIn order to catch mismatched sequences, you'd want to combine both of these function in a while loop. This becomes repetitive because the rest of the functions depend upon these in order to validate them. The best way to handle this is to abstract it into a Visitor Pattern, aka an Iterator.\n\n```c\nvoid* utf8_byte_iterate(const char* start, UTF8ByteIterator callback, void* context) {\n    if (!start || !callback) {\n        return NULL; // Invalid source or callback\n    }\n\n    const uint8_t* stream = (const uint8_t*) start;\n    while (*stream) {\n        // Determine the width of the current UTF-8 character\n        int8_t width = utf8_byte_width(stream);\n        if (width == -1 || !utf8_byte_is_valid(stream)) {\n            // Notify the callback of an invalid sequence and allow it to decide\n            void* result = callback(stream, -1, context);\n            if (result) {\n                return result; // Early return based on callback result\n            }\n            stream++; // Move past the invalid byte to prevent infinite loops\n            continue;\n        }\n\n        // Invoke the callback with the current character\n        void* result = callback(stream, width, context);\n        if (result) {\n            return result; // Early return based on callback result\n        }\n\n        stream += width; // Advance to the next character\n    }\n\n    return NULL; // Completed iteration without finding a result\n}\n```\n\nThis is non-trivial as an abstraction as the code base grows which is why it's best that these functions are embedded at a core level and are made opaque to the user. An excellent example of why this is the case is the Overlong Exploit.\n\n```c\n/**\n * @file examples/utf8_overlong.c\n * @brief CVE-2024-46954 Detail: An issue was discovered in decode_utf8 in base/gp_utf8.c in Artifex\n * Ghostscript before 10.04.0.

[CVE-2025-31161](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-31161)**\n\n- 📝 CrushFTP 10 before 10.8.4 and 11 before 11.3.1 allows authentication bypass and takeover of the crushadmin account (unless a DMZ proxy instance is used), as exploited in the wild in March and April 2025, aka Unauthenticated HTTP(S) port access. A race condition exists in the AWS4-HMAC (compatible with S3) authorization method of the HTTP component of the FTP server. The server first verifies the existence of the user by performing a call to login_user_pass() with no password requirement. This will authenticate the session through the HMAC verification process and up until the server checks for user verification once more. The vulnerability can be further stabilized, eliminating the need for successfully triggering a race condition, by sending a mangled AWS4-HMAC header. By providing only the username and a following slash (/), the server will successfully find a username, which triggers the successful anypass authentication process, but the server will fail to find the expected SignedHeaders entry, resulting in an index-out-of-bounds error that stops the code from reaching the session cleanup. Together, these issues make it trivial to authenticate as any known or guessable user (e.g., crushadmin), and can lead to a full compromise of the system by obtaining an administrative account.\n\n- 📅 **Published:** 03/04/2025\n- 📈 **CVSS:** 9.8\n- 🧭 **Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\n- 📣 **Mentions:** 59\n- ⚠️ **Priority:** 2\n\n---\n\n**2.

    "text": "\n**Google has addressed a significant vulnerability in Chrome's WebAudio component that could allow attackers to execute malicious code.**\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n- The vulnerability, identified as CVE-2025-4372, is a Use-After-Free issue.\n- Exploiting this flaw enables remote attackers to manipulate memory and execute arbitrary code.\n- The update raises concerns due to its high CVSS rating of 9.8, indicating critical potential for exploitation.\n\nGoogle has rolled out a critical security update for Chrome, targeting a serious vulnerability within the WebAudio API. This flaw, labeled as Use-After-Free, allows attackers to exploit memory corruption through maliciously crafted HTML pages. Such vulnerabilities are particularly dangerous because they do not require any user privileges or extensive user interaction, making them easy targets for cybercriminals. The vulnerability was discovered by Huang Xilin from Ant Group Light-Year Security Lab, who was rewarded $7,000 for his finding as part of Google’s vulnerability rewards program.\n\nThe recent patch addresses the root cause of the memory corruption by making the MediaStreamAudioDestinationNode an ActiveScriptWrappable component, ensuring that audio nodes are not prematurely destroyed while still in use by active scripts. Despite Google classifying the vulnerability as medium severity, several cybersecurity vendors have deemed it critical due to the ease of exploitation and the limited interaction required from users. This incident serves as a reminder of the persistent security challenges that arise from complex functionalities in web browsers, as similar vulnerabilities have been noted in the past.\n\nWhat steps do you take to ensure your online security in light of such vulnerabilities?\n\n**Learn More:** [Cyber Security News](https://cybersecuritynews.com/chrome-webaudio-vulnerability/)\n\n**Want to stay updated on the latest cyber threats?** \n\n 👉 **[Subscribe to /r/PwnHub](https://www.reddit.com/r/pwnhub)**",

    "text": "\n**A recently discovered vulnerability in the OttoKit WordPress plugin is being exploited by attackers to gain admin access to websites.**\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n- A new high-severity bug in the OttoKit plugin poses serious security risks for WordPress sites.\n- Threat actors can exploit the vulnerability to connect unauthorized accounts and create admin users.\n- Over 100,000 installations are at risk, emphasizing the urgent need for site owners to update their plugins.\n\nRecent reports have unveiled a significant vulnerability in the OttoKit WordPress plugin, used by over 100,000 installations for automation purposes. This vulnerability, identified as CVE-2025-27007 with a CVSS score of 9.8, allows unauthenticated attackers to gain administrative privileges on affected sites. The flaw resides in the 'create_wp_connection()' function, which incorrectly verifies user authentication, enabling attackers to manipulate access without requiring a known username.\n\nThis vulnerability comes shortly after another critical bug (CVE-2025-3102) was exploited to seize control of compromised sites. Attackers can initially connect to vulnerable sites, allowing them to create new administrative accounts. This presents a grave concern for website security as successful interference could lead to further exploitation or data breaches. Site administrators are strongly urged to upgrade to OttoKit version 1.0.83, which contains patches addressing both vulnerabilities to protect their websites promptly.\n\nWhat steps can site administrators take to enhance security against such vulnerabilities in the future?\n\n**Learn More:** [Security Week](https://www.securityweek.com/second-ottokit-vulnerability-exploited-to-hack-wordpress-sites/)\n\n**Want to stay updated on the latest cyber threats?** \n\n 👉 **[Subscribe to /r/PwnHub](https://www.reddit.com/r/pwnhub)**",

    "text": "If you're using Tails OS and think setting the Tor Browser to “Safest” mode disables JavaScript right away, think again.\n\nThe Problem:\n\nChanging the security level to “Safest” does not fully disable JavaScript until you restart the browser.\n\nThat means JavaScript can still be active for the rest of your session — even if you haven’t visited any websites yet.\n\nWorse, Tails does not let you save this setting, or any about:config changes (like javascript.enabled = false), even with Persistent Storage enabled.\n\n\nThis is a huge opsec risk, especially after vulnerabilities like CVE-2024-9680, which allowed attackers to deanonymize users even in Safest mode if JavaScript wasn’t properly shut down.\n\nWhat You Must Do:\n\n1. Before visiting any site, go to:\n\nabout:config\n\nSet javascript.enabled = false\n\n\n\n2. Restart the Tor Browser immediately.\n\n\n3. Repeat this every single time you reboot Tails.\n\n\n\nThere is no official way to automate or save this unless you build a custom Tails image (not beginner-friendly).\n\n\n---\n\nTL;DR:\nTails resets all browser settings, and Tor’s “Safest” mode isn’t safe until after a full restart. If you’re doing anything risky, manually disable JS and restart your browser before use — every time.\n\nThis problem was hidden away in a forum Tor-Project discussion a developer was talking about [Tor-Project Forum discussion](https://forum.torproject.org/t/struggling-with-javascript-and-add-ons-in-tor-browser/17059)\n\nhttps://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser/-/issues/42572",

One of the vulnerabilities, assigned CVE-2025-32819, has garnered attention due to its high CVSS score of 8.8, indicating a severe risk. This flaw enables authenticated users to bypass security mechanisms and delete arbitrary files, which could lead to unauthorized factory resets of the appliance. Rapid7 also reported that this could be exploited as a zero-day, suggesting that it may have already been targeted by attackers.\n\nIn addition to this, the other two vulnerabilities, CVE-2025-32820 and CVE-2025-32821, allow attackers to inject harmful code and overwrite critical files, potentially resulting in a lasting denial of service. These vulnerabilities can be chained together, allowing malicious actors to escalate privileges from basic authenticated user to an administrator level. This poses a substantial threat to data integrity and system availability, as attackers could execute arbitrary code with root privileges if they successfully exploit these flaws. Updating to the patched version 10.2.1.15-81sv is essential for security and protection against ongoing threats.\n\nHow do you prioritize patch management in your organization to mitigate risks from vulnerabilities like these?\n\n**Learn More:** [Security Week](https://www.securityweek.com/possible-zero-day-patched-in-sonicwall-sma-appliances/)\n\n**Want to stay updated on the latest cyber threats?** \n\n 👉 **[Subscribe to /r/PwnHub](https://www.reddit.com/r/pwnhub)**",

    "title": "A closer look at Fog ransomware",
    "text": "*Fog ransomware is a sophisticated threat actor known for rapid encryption and lack of centralized organization. This post explores the origins, operations, attacks, and the known unknowns of Fog.*\n\n[Christine Barry, Apr. 30, 2025](https://blog.barracuda.com/2025/04/29/a-closer-look-at-fog-ransomware-)\n\nFog ransomware emerged in April 2024 as a sophisticated cyberthreat that combined rapid encryption with double extortion tactics. Fog threat actors initially targeted educational institutions through compromised VPN accounts. They soon expanded their scope to government agencies and business sectors. As of February 2025, [the top five sectors victimized by Fog](https://socradar.io/dark-web-profile-fog-ransomware/) are business services, technology, education, manufacturing, and government. Most of Fog’s victims are based in the United States.\n\nResearchers suspect that Fog threat actors operate from Russia or other former Soviet nations, because they conspicuously avoid targeting the Eastern European countries and the People’s Republic of China. In a 2024 attack, researchers [traced the origin of Fog-related IP address to Moscow](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366609793/Fog-ransomware-crew-evolving-into-wide-ranging-threat).\n\n# Group or variant?\n\nAnalysts have been careful to distinguish Fog ransomware as a variant, rather than a threat group. There doesn’t appear to be any evidence of a centralized operation behind the use of Fog. It can be used by different threat actors to carry out attacks, and [the developers are separate from those performing the intrusions](https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/100780-research-reveals-new-ransomware-variant-called-fog).\n\nRansomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) affiliates also operate separately from ransomware developers, but there is always evidence of an organizational hierarchy or a separation of duties behind the software. There are rules and payment structures for the affiliates. We can’t consider Fog a RaaS operation because it doesn’t fit that description.\n\nWe also can’t rule out the possibility that Fog is or was intended to be used in a RaaS operation. Its modular design allows attackers to control what gets encrypted, the pace of the attack, the scope of encryption, and the content of the ransom note. It’s possible that it was developed with a RaaS operation in mind.\n\nAlthough Fog doesn’t appear to be a single organization, it does fit the commonly understood parameters of a ‘threat actor group.’ Fog attackers share infrastructure and malware, they have common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), and they use similar phishing emails, ransom notes and negotiation chats across attacks. There is also a Fog branded leak site and negotiation portal, which means these threat actors are coordinating on how they communicate with the victims.\n\nFog actors have also been observed [communicating during attacks](https://web.archive.org/web/20250421230403/https:/www.darktrace.com/blog/lifting-the-fog-darktraces-investigation-into-fog-ransomware) using command-and-control (C2C) servers and encrypted communication channels.\n\n# Fog by the numbers\n\nBased on available data, analysts have calculated the following metrics:\n\n* Number of publicly reported victims: [189 as of April 2025](https://www.ransomware.live/group/fog)\n* Median initial ransom demand: [$220,000](https://areteir.com/article/malware-spotlight-fog-ransomware-technical-analysis/)\n* Median ransom payment: [$100,000](https://areteir.com/article/malware-spotlight-fog-ransomware-technical-analysis/)  \n\nThe amount collected by Fog is unknown. If all publicly reported victims paid the median ransom payment, that would be $18.9 million. We know that not all victims pay the ransom, and not all incidents are reported. A recent survey found that [86% of organizations (globally) have paid ransom demands in the past year](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3968299/global-firms-succumb-to-ransomware-86-pay-up-despite-having-advanced-backup-tools.html), which is interesting, but probably not applicable to victims of Fog.\n\nThere is no evidence that Fog threat actors are motivated by anything other than money. They have not declared any nation-state allegiance or shown support for an ideology or cause.\n\n# How Fog works\n\nFog usually spreads through one of the following initial access methods:\n\n* **Compromised SonicWall VPN accounts**: These accounts are usually purchased through an initial access broker (IAB) but could be stolen directly through phishing campaigns.\n* **Vulnerability exploitation**: The group actively targets unpatched software, particularly Veeam Backup & Replication (CVE-2024-40711)\n* **Phishing campaigns**: Fog threat actors use phishing campaigns to deploy the ransomware loader. These emails usually pose as a VPN update request, an unpaid invoice inquiry, and a human resources (HR) policy change notification. The attachments act differently, but all result in attempts to download the Fog ransomware loader.\n\nRecent phishing campaigns have used [phishing emails with a ZIP file attachment that contains a malicious LNK shortcut](https://www.scworld.com/news/fog-ransomware-notes-troll-with-doge-references-bait-insider-attacks). The LNK file executes a command that downloads a PowerShell script named \"stage1.ps1\" from an attacker-controlled domain. The script then downloads several payloads and supporting files. Ransom notes associated with these attacks have added insult to injury by mocking victims with references to [Edward Coristine](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/02/teen-on-musks-doge-team-graduated-from-the-com/) and the [U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)](https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/fog-hackers-doge-ransom-notes). \n\n[Fog phishing email - fake VPN update \\(mockup\\)](https://preview.redd.it/huv7xll5fmze1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=a667ae63f9d447089471e0c6a1eb0d687b42ad30)\n\n[DOGE-related Fog ransomnote pop-up message, via PCMag](https://preview.redd.it/8otxykk7fmze1.png?width=297&format=png&auto=webp&s=347f8d15dacafac745650d09b967f4d7a65b9182)\n\n[DOGE-related Fog ransom note, via PCMag](https://preview.redd.it/356xgombfmze1.png?width=677&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a06cf7705308313a7a385ab22269785b310d09b)\n\nResearchers have determined there is no real affiliation between Fog ransomware and DOGE.\n\nOnce inside the system, Fog immediately begins system reconnaissance and attempts to establish persistence by modifying system configurations and deploying additional scripts that keep the malware active after a system reboot. The next step is to gain administrative control by using tools like [Mimikatz](https://www.csoonline.com/article/566987/what-is-mimikatz-and-how-to-defend-against-this-password-stealing-tool.html) and techniques like [LSASS memory dumping](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/10/05/detecting-and-preventing-lsass-credential-dumping-attacks) and [NTLM relay attacks](https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2024/12/mitigating-ntlm-relay-attacks-by-default/). Fog will also establish anti-recovery measures, like encrypting backups and deleting volume shadow copies.\n\nThe attack proceeds with lateral movement and data exfiltration. Fog actors use the zero-knowledge cloud service [Mega.nz](http://Mega.nz) to store stolen data prior to encrypting the network. This sets up the double extortion scheme. When this is complete, Fog will encrypt documents, databases, backups, and any other critical operational data. The extensions .fog, .Fog, or .FLOCKED are appended to the encrypted files, and ransom notes named \"readme.txt\" are distributed across the network. The victim's information is added to the Fog leak site. \n\n[Fog ransom note, via SocRadar](https://preview.redd.it/vyjcs9sgfmze1.png?width=825&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e73dc34d2ffd159af0f6319bdf4315da42d1520)\n\n[The University of Oklahoma appears on the Fog leak site, via DarkWebInformer](https://preview.redd.it/189894fifmze1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b4c2ef9850f8121df1674ec2aed15135a4b8979)\n\n# After the attack\n\nNegotiation tactics follow the same as those of other groups. \n\n*If you want your data fully decrypted and the files we stole removed from our source, you will have to pay a fee. We will also be able to provide a security report and explain how we did it to get in. (*[*source*](https://www.ransomware.live/nego/fog/20240927)*)*\n\nFog starts with a high ransom demand and will compromise on a lower amount if it is acceptable. \n\n[Fog threat actors negotiate ransom amount with victim, via Ransomware.Live.](https://preview.redd.it/h2je0b6vfmze1.png?width=792&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5658cc747153b72f164ca181f011de981ef67ec)\n\nUpon payment, Fog will send decryption keys and confirm the deletion of the stolen data. In two of the chats available [here](https://www.ransomware.live/), the victim had difficulties recovering and had to troubleshoot with the threat actor:\n\n[Troubleshooting Fog decryption, credit Ransomware.Live](https://preview.redd.it/pi3apyj2gmze1.png?width=718&format=png&auto=webp&s=84af5eaa7a28df09231446b437488f4024714a58)\n\n[Troubleshooting Fog decryption, via Ransomware.Live](https://preview.redd.it/zc3rq9l6gmze1.png?width=716&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f0926ebdc838d6621042b49e312396f9c66b93c)\n\nThe security report promised by Fog probably isn’t useful for victims that are already following best practices. \n\n*Access to your network was gained through a phishing mail. Your staff should be more vigilant when downloading and opening unfamiliar files. We recommend that you implement the following measures to protect your corporate network: 1) Enforce passwords on local and domain admins. Complicate group policy on passwords for all users; 2) Using the group \"Protected users\"; 3) Use centralised management of antivirus protection; 4) Inform users not to open suspicious emails and files; 5) Updating software and OS to current versions; 6) Set up permission delegations in the Active Directory; 7) Install an application to monitor activity in the Active Directory; 8) Use Vmware Esxi ver. 7.0 or more current. Our team guarantees that any data taken from your network will not be disclosed, sold or published. Of course, this dialogue will also remain confidential.

An analysis of Fog intrusions via compromised SonicWall VPN accounts shows that [only 25% of the intrusions were linked directly to Fog](https://thehackernews.com/2025/03/the-new-ransomware-groups-shaking-up.html). The remaining 75% of Fog intrusions were linked to [Akira ransomware](https://blog.barracuda.com/2025/02/11/akira--modern-ransomware-with-a-retro-vibe), suggesting collaboration and shared infrastructure. Fog and Akira also use similar tools and exploits and are known for their rapid encryption techniques.\n\nFog has also been linked to Conti ransomware through shared cryptocurrency wallets. Researchers linked [Akira to Conti](https://blog.barracuda.com/2025/02/11/akira--modern-ransomware-with-a-retro-vibe) in 2023, so the link to Conti is not surprising, but it is noteworthy to investigators and researchers. Here's the high-level overview of the Conti family:\n\n* Ryuk: August 2018 - early 2022. Evolved from Hermes and is the direct precursor to Conti.\n* Conti: December 2019 - June 2022.

Closely linked to Conti.\n* [BlackSuit](https://blog.barracuda.com/2024/10/29/blacksuit-ransomware--8-years--6-names--1-cybercrime-syndicate): Emerged in Mid-2023 and active as of 2025. Rebrand or evolution of Royal.\n* Fog: Emerged in April 2024 and active as of 2025. Linked to Akira and Conti.\n\nConti was first observed in December 2019 and was [fully offline by June 2022](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/conti-ransomware-finally-shuts-down-data-leak-negotiation-sites/). Looking at Fog ransomware in this context underscores the fact that ***new*** does not mean ***inexperienced***. Criminal expertise, code advancements and attack techniques move fluidly between these groups.  \n\n# Notable attacks\n\nIn June 2024, Darktrace observed multiple Fog ransomware attacks across customer environments, including one that took less than two hours from initial access to complete file encryption. This was the first attack to demonstrate Fog’s speed and sophistication. The attack methods included outgoing NTLM authentication attempts to another internal device, which was then used to establish a remote connection to a Windows server running Hyper-V. This attack was notable for speed and efficiency, and is one of the first indicators that multiple Fog actors collaborate in real-time. \n\nOne of the most interesting attacks took place in August 2024, when Fog targeted a financial services company. Intruders logged in through a VPN account using stolen credentials. Security teams [traced the IP of this intruder to Moscow](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366609793/Fog-ransomware-crew-evolving-into-wide-ranging-threat), providing researchers with their first evidence of Fog’s Russian origins. The attack was also one of the first that targeted a sector other than education.  The attack was detected prior to encryption and was therefore unsuccessful.\n\nFog threat actors targeted the [Brazilian Government Ministries in July 2023](https://www.occrp.org/en/scoop/ransomware-attack-on-brazilian-govt-exposes-fog-cyber-gang), resulting in the compromise of nine ministries, the nation’s mint, and its anti-money laundering agency. Attackers demanded $1.2 million, but there is no evidence that a ransom was paid. The incident is still under investigation.\n\nThis attack was claimed by Fog in the ransom note and the victim is listed on the Fog leak site, but it did take place nine months before Fog emerged as a threat. This is possible because the emergence of a threat commonly refers to when a threat is observed and publicly acknowledged. There can be a significant delay between the first attack and the first industry / researcher observation. After a threat emerges, researchers begin to connect the new threat with old attacks. This is referred to as ‘retrospective linking.’\n\n# Defend yourself\n\nDefending against Fog and other ransomware threat actors starts with best practices and layered security. Start with strong authentication systems that include multifactor authentication (MFA) and [zero trust access](https://www.barracuda.com/products/network-protection/secureedge/zero-trust-access?utm_source=04282025&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=blog). Maintain a strong patch management system and close technical vulnerabilities like unused VPN accounts.\n\nYou can restrict the movement of intruders by segmenting networks and isolating sensitive data and backup systems. Zero trust access enables microsegmentation by isolating individual workloads and applying continuous verification across users and devices.\n\nConsider adding advanced security to your network with [Barracuda Managed XDR](https://www.barracuda.com/products/managed-xdr?utm_source=04282025&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=blog). This solution can identify and stop Fog’s malicious activities before encryption and data exfiltration.

    "text": "Cisco has patched [a critical security flaw](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-wlc-file-uplpd-rHZG9UfC) that attackers could use to upload arbitrary files to a vulnerable system. The vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2025-20188 and is [rated a 10.0 on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss) (CVSS). The exploit takes advantage of a hard-coded **JSON Web Token (JWT)** for authentication in the Out-of-Band Access Point (AP) Image Download feature of [Cisco IOS XE Software](https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/products/networking/cloud-networking/ios-xe/index.html) for Wireless LAN Controllers (WLCs).\n\nTo understand how this exploit works, let’s start by looking at the [JSON Web Token](https://jwt.io/introduction). The easiest way to describe a JWT is that it enables authentication by securely transmitting data between parties. We can illustrate the JWT by using the example of a user logging in to an application. The process begins with the user submitting credentials to the application server. Assuming the user is authorized and JWT is in place, the server will generate a JSON Web Token that includes the user’s authentication data. This token is sent to the client device where it will be stored.\n\nThe server retains no information about the user and relies on the server-client JWT communication to grant future requests. If the client-side token holds valid credentials, the server will grant access to the permitted resources.\n\nThe affected Cisco system used a hard-coded JSON Web Token in their software image. This is like using a hard-coded password in an IoT or networking device. Once someone has the image or device in hand, he can extract the password using any number of ‘hacking’ methods.\n\nIf an attacker is attempting to exploit [CVE-2025-20188](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2025-20188), getting that token information is the first step. The next step is to identify vulnerable devices, probably by automated scanning or referencing earlier reconnaissance. Once the token and the targets are known, the attacker creates a custom HTTPS request that includes the hard-coded JWT information. The request can be designed to upload malicious files or directly run commands with root privileges. At this point, the attack chain could include a broad range of tactics, from deploying ransomware to stealth/passive traffic monitoring.\n\nThere are no workarounds for this vulnerability, but administrators can mitigate this vulnerability by disabling the Out-of-Band AP Image Download feature. Like all workarounds and other mitigations, this method should be tested once it is in place. The security patch should be applied as soon as possible. Cisco has listed [vulnerable and non-vulnerable devices here](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-wlc-file-uplpd-rHZG9UfC).\n\n",

    "text": "Here’s a quick breakdown of the 10 most interesting vulnerabilities trending today:\n\n**1. [CVE-2024-11477](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-11477)**\n\n- 📝 7-Zip Zstandard Decompression Integer Underflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of 7-Zip. Interaction with this library is required to exploit this vulnerability but attack vectors may vary depending on the implementation. The specific flaw exists within the implementation of Zstandard decompression. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in an integer underflow before writing to memory. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24346.\n\n- 📅 **Published:** 22/11/2024\n- 📈 **CVSS:** 7.8\n- 🧭 **Vector:** CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\n- 📣 **Mentions:** 15\n- ⚠️ **Priority:** 2\n\n---\n\n**2. [CVE-2025-30147](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-30147)**\n\n- 📝 Besu Native contains scripts and tooling that is used to build and package the native libraries used by the Ethereum client Hyperledger Besu. Besu 24.7.1 through 25.2.2, corresponding to besu-native versions 0.9.0 through 1.2.1, have a potential consensus bug for the precompiles ALTBN128_ADD (0x06), ALTBN128_MUL (0x07), and ALTBN128_PAIRING (0x08). These precompiles were reimplemented in besu-native using gnark-cryptos bn254 implementation, as the former implementation used a library which was no longer maintained and not sufficiently performant. The new gnark implementation was initially added in version 0.9.0 of besu-native but was not utilized by Besu until version 0.9.2 in Besu 24.7.1. The issue is that there are EC points which may be crafted which are in the correct subgroup but are not on the curve and the besu-native gnark implementation was relying on subgroup checks to perform point-on-curve checks as well. The version of gnark-crypto used at the time did not do this check when performing subgroup checks. The result is that it was possible for Besu to give an incorrect result and fall out of consensus when executing one of these precompiles against a specially crafted input point. Additionally, homogenous Besu-only networks can potentially enshrine invalid state which would be incorrect and difficult to process with patched versions of besu which handle these calls correctly. The underlying defect has been patched in besu-native release 1.3.0. The fixed version of Besu is version 25.3.0. As a workaround for versions of Besu with the problem, the native precompile for altbn128 may be disabled in favor of the pure-java implementation. The pure java implementation is significantly slower, but does not have this consensus issue.\n\n- 📅 **Published:** 07/05/2025\n- 📈 **CVSS:** 8.7\n- 🧭 **Vector:** CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N\n- 📣 **Mentions:** 4\n- ⚠️ **Priority:** 2\n\n---\n\n**3.

The following error was returned from the certificate validation process: A certification chain processed correctly, but one of the CA certificates is not trusted by the policy provider.`\n\n`The processing of Group Policy failed.

The certificate SRV008 in the error message is chained to this CA.\n\nAnyone else with a similar expericene?",

L’exploit opera solo in modalità utente e non permette l’accesso ai privilegi di sistema necessari per installare homebrew o modificare profondamente il sistema.\\\nPer ottenere un jailbreak effettivo, è indispensabile un exploit di tipo kernel, che il developer Al Azif sta attualmente cercando di portare a termine.\\\nFonte: x.comDiscover the best curtains shop in Dubai, where style meets quality and customization.

    "text": "I am working on a new app and thought that I should give Cursor a shot at adding GitHub based auth to my app because adding social auth to apps is kinda difficult and easy to get wrong.\n\nI asked cursor to go ahead and add it and here's what it did:\n\n1. Downgraded the version of `social-auth-app-django` in my app from 5.4.3 to 5.4.0\n2. Added the `python-jose` JWT library (for creating signed auth tokens), version 3.3.0\n3. Added the following two settings for the JWT library:\n   1. `JWT_SECRET_KEY = 'your-jwt-secret-key'`\n   2. `JWT_ALGORITHM = 'HS256'`\n4. Incorrectly wired up a new view that just hands out tokens for already authenticated users.\n\nYou may be thinking: \"that version bump seems pretty minor\" and \"version 3.3.0 of jose is close to 3.4.0 (latest version at the time)\"...\n\nBut what that gets you is:\n\n1. Downgrading the social auth python package results in [CVE-2024-32879](https://github.com/python-social-auth/social-app-django/security/advisories/GHSA-2gr8-3wc7-xhj3) (moderate sev) being present in my application (which was patched in 5.4.1).\n2. Adding `python-jose` version 3.3.0 contains the following 2 CVEs, the first of which is CRITICAL severity:\n   1. [CVE-2024-33663](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-6c5p-j8vq-pqhj) (critical severity)\n   2. [CVE-2024-33664](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-cjwg-qfpm-7377) (moderate severity)\n3. The defaulting of the JWT secret key to a valid placeholder string along with the file diff not showing the addition of this string.\n\n  \nThis means that when someone is lost in the vibes and just keeps clicking \"Accept\" every time a new change is suggested (which every vibe coder does), we now have an application with 4 separate, distinct vulnerabilities and a hacker's dream come true! Your vibes won't be able to protect you. Vibe coding IDEs must fix this and pay more attention to dependency versioning at the very least.\n\nAdditionally, these things can go unnoticed for YEARS now that the code that vibe-coding IDEs produce is less-than human readable and a jumbled pile of spaghetti. As time progresses, more and more of these vibe-coded systems will be grandfathered into production and humans will no longer be able to understand the vulnerabilities.\n\nTread with caution. Use Cursor as a crutch and not a replacement for your human brain. Do your due diligence and review the code that Cursor spits out.",

The server first verifies the existence of the user by performing a call to login_user_pass() with no password requirement. This will authenticate the session through the HMAC verification process and up until the server checks for user verification once more. The vulnerability can be further stabilized, eliminating the need for successfully triggering a race condition, by sending a mangled AWS4-HMAC header. By providing only the username and a following slash (/), the server will successfully find a username, which triggers the successful anypass authentication process, but the server will fail to find the expected SignedHeaders entry, resulting in an index-out-of-bounds error that stops the code from reaching the session cleanup. Together, these issues make it trivial to authenticate as any known or guessable user (e.g., crushadmin), and can lead to a full compromise of the system by obtaining an administrative account.\n\n- 📅 **Published:** 03/04/2025\n- 📈 **CVSS:** 9.8\n- 🧭 **Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\n- 📣 **Mentions:** 59\n- ⚠️ **Priority:** 2\n\n---\n\n**5.

    "text": "Hi all! It's me, Holloway again. My sincere apology for the frequest posting. There was security vulnerability discovered by u/apvs and I need to responsbily patch the product so that the community are safe.\n\nThis release covers the following features:\n\n1. Fixed CVE-2025-47276 (https://github.com/ChewKeanHo/Actualizer/security/advisories/GHSA-v626-chv9-v9qr) & Log (https://github.com/ChewKeanHo/Actualizer/issues/1)\n2. Product is now licensed as Zero BSD (total freedom for both commercial and non-commercial deployment).\n3. Re-implement manual bit-wiping prior to cryptsetup formatting. You will notice a long dd time against the `CORE` datastore partition for security integrity.\n4. Auto-install all its dependencies (no more manual efforts).\n\nAvailable now at: https://github.com/ChewKeanHo/Actualizer/releases/tag/v1.2.0\n\n\n\n\n## What's the CVE about?\n\nIn summary: OpenSSL's `passwd` was using `SHA512` (blatantly wrong algorithm) for password hashing. It slipped under my radar (and wasn't expect a vital network TLS tool can do such a blatant mistake). Thanks to `u/apvs` insight, the problem got fixed overnight.\n\nYes, I was disappointed as well because this simple project now have a CVE.\n\nFull story is at: https://github.com/ChewKeanHo/Actualizer/issues/1\n\n\n### What to do with existing builds?\n\nJust reset both the \"Alpha\" and \"root\" accounts to a new password. Debian OS will take over and process with the correct one. \n\nNo restart required.\n\n\n### What was Used Instead?\n\n`mkpasswd` from `whois`, with explicit method stated (https://github.com/ChewKeanHo/Actualizer/blob/main/Shell/debian-minbase-install.sh#L834).\n\n----\n\nOnce again. My apology for the frequent posting. I just want the community be safe; at least under my flag.\n\nCheers and have a happy day!",

The server first verifies the existence of the user by performing a call to login_user_pass() with no password requirement. This will authenticate the session through the HMAC verification process and up until the server checks for user verification once more. The vulnerability can be further stabilized, eliminating the need for successfully triggering a race condition, by sending a mangled AWS4-HMAC header. By providing only the username and a following slash (/), the server will successfully find a username, which triggers the successful anypass authentication process, but the server will fail to find the expected SignedHeaders entry, resulting in an index-out-of-bounds error that stops the code from reaching the session cleanup. Together, these issues make it trivial to authenticate as any known or guessable user (e.g., crushadmin), and can lead to a full compromise of the system by obtaining an administrative account.\n\n- 📅 **Published:** 03/04/2025\n- 📈 **CVSS:** 9.8\n- 🧭 **Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\n- 📣 **Mentions:** 59\n- ⚠️ **Priority:** 2\n\n---\n\n**5.

This vulnerability grants remote attackers the ability to access files arbitrarily, allowing them to extract sensitive data from targets. The espionage campaign has primarily affected Kurdish military personnel operating in Iraq, showcasing a shift in targeting strategies within the ongoing geopolitical tensions in the region.\n\nThe hacking group has demonstrated a significant increase in technical capability by successfully utilizing a zero-day exploit, which reflects a maturation of their operational tactics. The attack process typically involves infiltrating the Output Messenger Server Manager with stolen credentials obtained via methods like DNS hijacking. Once inside, the attackers leverage the vulnerability to drop malicious payloads, which give them control over the affected servers through data exfiltration techniques. Such operations not only compromise individual target data but could potentially threaten wider networks and sensitive communications within the region.\n\nHow can organizations ensure their communication platforms are safeguarded against zero-day exploits like this?\n\n**Learn More:** [The Hacker News](https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/turkiye-hackers-exploited-output.html)\n\n**Want to stay updated on the latest cyber threats?** \n\n 👉 **[Subscribe to /r/PwnHub](https://www.reddit.com/r/pwnhub)**",

This flaw allows unauthorized access to private messages and group chats that were intended to be secure, which raises the stakes for data security not only for individuals but also for government officials who may use the application. This incident underscores the broader implications of using messaging apps that claim to offer encryption but fail to deliver adequate protection against data breaches.\n\nAs part of their response, Smarsh, the parent company of TeleMessage, has suspended all services related to the app while conducting a thorough investigation into the security breach. Notably, this flaw has already been categorized under CVE-2025-47729, indicating that it has actively been exploited in the wild. Consequently, federal agencies are facing pressure to remediate reported vulnerabilities within a stringent timeframe of three weeks. For other organizations, monitoring the vulnerability database is crucial for proper risk management and ensuring that they prioritize patching their systems effectively. However, due to the server-side nature of this flaw, individual users of TeleMessage can do little aside from discontinuing its use until a permanent solution is implemented.\n\nHow can organizations better assess the security of the messaging applications they use?\n\n**Learn More:** [Security Week](https://www.securityweek.com/cisa-warns-of-flaw-in-telemessage-app-used-by-ex-national-security-advisor/)\n\n**Want to stay updated on the latest cyber threats?** \n\n 👉 **[Subscribe to /r/PwnHub](https://www.reddit.com/r/pwnhub)**",

    "text": "Hello Proxmox community,\n\nI just received a Wazuh security alert for a critical vulnerability (CVE-2025-43859) in python3-h11 version 0.14.0-1, which is installed on my Proxmox server. The vulnerability apparently allows unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via HTTP request splitting with CRLF injection.\n\n**My System Details:**\n\n* Proxmox VE: 8.4.0 (running kernel: 6.8.12-10-pve)\n* pve-manager: 8.4.1\n* Debian: 12.10\n* AMD EPYC 7302P 16-Core Processor with 64GB RAM\n* Running 4 VMs and 26 containers\n\nAfter some investigation, I found:\n\n* There's no updated version available in Debian repositories or backports yet\n* The CVE has a 2025 date which is odd (possibly a typo?)\n* python3-h11 is only used by python3-httpcore and python3-httpx on my system\n* I couldn't find any evidence of httpx/httpcore being used by my system services or cron jobs\n* h11 version 0.14.0 is confirmed to be installed and loadable\n\nMy questions for the community:\n\n1. Is anyone else seeing this alert?\n2. Has anyone confirmed if this vulnerability actually affects Proxmox functionality?\n3. Is it safe to simply remove python3-h11 (and its dependent packages) from a Proxmox host?\n4. Does the Proxmox web interface or any core Proxmox functionality actually use these Python HTTP libraries?\n\nI've run `apt --simulate remove python3-h11` and it would only remove:\n\n* python3-h11\n* python3-httpcore\n* python3-httpx\n\nI'm trying to decide between:\n\n* Removing the vulnerable package (simplest but could break something)\n* Waiting for an official Debian/Proxmox patch (safest but leaves vulnerability)\n* Manually updating with pip (risky on system Python)\n\nAny insights from others who have dealt with this would be greatly appreciated!\n\n**Technical details for those interested:**  \nThe vulnerability allows HTTP request splitting attacks when h11 is used with certain HTTP proxies. It's rated as Critical (CVSS 9.8) but requires a specific combination of h11 and a vulnerable proxy with certain parsing bugs. \n\nThanks in advance for any help or insights!",

[CVE-2025-31161](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-31161)**\n\n- 📝 CrushFTP 10 before 10.8.4 and 11 before 11.3.1 allows authentication bypass and takeover of the crushadmin account (unless a DMZ proxy instance is used), as exploited in the wild in March and April 2025, aka \"Unauthenticated HTTP(S) port access.\" A race condition exists in the AWS4-HMAC (compatible with S3) authorization method of the HTTP component of the FTP server. The server first verifies the existence of the user by performing a call to login_user_pass() with no password requirement. This will authenticate the session through the HMAC verification process and up until the server checks for user verification once more. The vulnerability can be further stabilized, eliminating the need for successfully triggering a race condition, by sending a mangled AWS4-HMAC header. By providing only the username and a following slash (/), the server will successfully find a username, which triggers the successful anypass authentication process, but the server will fail to find the expected SignedHeaders entry, resulting in an index-out-of-bounds error that stops the code from reaching the session cleanup. Together, these issues make it trivial to authenticate as any known or guessable user (e.g., crushadmin), and can lead to a full compromise of the system by obtaining an administrative account.\n\n- 📅 **Published:** 03/04/2025\n- 📈 **CVSS:** 9.8\n- 🧭 **Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\n- 📣 **Mentions:** 59\n- ⚠️ **Priority:** 2\n\n---\n\n**5.

    "text": "\n**Critical vulnerabilities discovered in TheGem WordPress theme expose sites to remote code execution risks.**\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n- Two critical vulnerabilities identified in TheGem theme versions 5.10.3 and earlier.\n- Attackers can upload malicious files due to improper file validation.\n- The vulnerabilities can lead to complete site compromise if exploited.\n- A patch was released by CodexThemes to fix the identified issues.\n- Site administrators urged to act immediately to secure their websites.\n\nResearch has revealed two interconnected vulnerabilities affecting TheGem, a widely used premium WordPress theme. The first, a critical file upload vulnerability (CVE-2025-4317), arises from a failure to properly validate file types, allowing authenticated users with minimal permissions to upload potentially harmful files. The second vulnerability (CVE-2025-4339) concerns insufficient authorization checks, enabling users to modify theme settings, including the logo URL, potentially redirecting it to malicious content. This creates a scenario where an attacker can exploit one vulnerability to initiate a chain reaction that ultimately leads to remote code execution and site control.\n\nThe implications of these vulnerabilities are significant, particularly given the popularity of WordPress, powering approximately 43% of all websites. Cybercriminals can capitalize on these weaknesses to deploy attacks at scale. The security community has taken notice, and Wordfence has warned users about the risks, emphasizing the need for immediate action. Patch version 5.10.3.1 has been released to address these vulnerabilities, and users are strongly encouraged to update their sites promptly to mitigate potential threats. Additionally, adopting security measures such as web application firewalls and actively monitoring user permissions can further enhance site security in light of these vulnerabilities.\n\nWhat steps are you taking to ensure the security of your WordPress sites?\n\n**Learn More:** [Cyber Security News](https://cybersecuritynews.com/wordpress-remote-code-execution-attacks/)\n\n**Want to stay updated on the latest cyber threats?** \n\n 👉 **[Subscribe to /r/PwnHub](https://www.reddit.com/r/pwnhub)**",

The server first verifies the existence of the user by performing a call to login_user_pass() with no password requirement. This will authenticate the session through the HMAC verification process and up until the server checks for user verification once more. The vulnerability can be further stabilized, eliminating the need for successfully triggering a race condition, by sending a mangled AWS4-HMAC header. By providing only the username and a following slash (/), the server will successfully find a username, which triggers the successful anypass authentication process, but the server will fail to find the expected SignedHeaders entry, resulting in an index-out-of-bounds error that stops the code from reaching the session cleanup. Together, these issues make it trivial to authenticate as any known or guessable user (e.g., crushadmin), and can lead to a full compromise of the system by obtaining an administrative account.\n\n- 📅 **Published:** 03/04/2025\n- 📈 **CVSS:** 9.8\n- 🧭 **Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\n- 📣 **Mentions:** 59\n- ⚠️ **Priority:** 2\n\n---\n\n**5.

    "title": "The Hidden Security Cost of Closed Source AI Coding Assistants",
    "text": "There's an important security consideration that isn't getting enough attention in the developer community. While many of us are racing to adopt AI-powered coding tools, there's a fundamental security trade-off happening with closed-source forks of open-source projects.\n\n## The Systematic Issue\n\nClosed-source forks of open-source projects like VS Code face a structural challenge: security updates don't automatically flow downstream in a timely manner.\n\nFor example, Cursor (a popular VS Code fork with AI features) has been observed running Python extension version 2024.13.0 - which remains vulnerable to CVE-2024-49050, a critical remote code execution vulnerability patched in VS Code months ago.\n\nThis pattern extends beyond just one extension or vulnerability - it's inherent to the development model of closed-source forks.\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nWhen a vulnerability is patched in VS Code (the upstream project), it essentially becomes a zero-day for unpatched forks. The exploit details are public, but the fix hasn't been applied. It's the worst of both worlds from a security perspective.\n\n## Key Findings\n\n* **Security Debt** Forking open-source projects creates an ongoing integration burden, especially for security patches\n* **Vulnerability Window** Users of closed-source forks face an extended period of exposure to known CVEs\n* **Transparency Gap** Users often have no visibility into which extension versions they're running or how they compare to upstream versions\n\n## What You Can Do\n\nIf you're using Cursor or another VS Code fork:\n\n1. Monitor security announcements for VS Code and popular extensions\n2. Check your extension versions against the latest in the official marketplace\n3. Consider manually installing critical updates if possible\n4. Push vendors to prioritize security patch integration\n\n# Looking for Discussion\n\n* Have you encountered similar security issues with VS Code forks?\n* How do you balance the productivity gains of AI tools with security concerns?\n* What responsibility do you think fork maintainers have in this ecosystem?\n\nRead our [full analysis here](https://blog.kilocode.ai/p/security-blindspots-in-closed-source) for more details and join our Discord for further discussion.",

    "text": "Hola, como andan?  Soy yo de vuelta, Y0d4h, en el dia de hoy voy a hablar sobre Common Vulnerabilitiers and Exposures (CVE), el resumen lo queria hacer para la semana pasada pero por temas de tiempo no pude hacerlo.\n\nEmpecemos!!!\n\nPara hablar del CVE, primero hay que hablar del Open Vulnerability Assesmente Language(OVAL) y que es exactamente OVAL? Bueno es un estandar internacional de seguridad de la información disponible públicamente diseñado para evaluar el estado del sistema. Este tiene tres objetivos:\n\n\\- Identificar las configuraciones de un sistema que deben analizarse.\n\n\\- Evaluar el estado actual del sistema\n\n\\- Generar informes con la información obtenida.\n\nAdemas OVAL posee cuatro clases principales de definiciones: Identifica las vulnerabilidades del sistema,verifica el cumplimiento de configuraciones con ciertos requisitos, detecta softwares específicos instalados en el sistema y por ultimo identifica si tiene un parche adecuado.\n\nOtro tip a tener en cuenta es la sintaxis de OVAL: \n\n\"oval:Organization Domain Name:ID Type:ID Value\".\n\n\n\nBueno ahora que paso el breve resumen, que es Common Vulnerabilitiers and Exposures(CVE)? Este es un catalogo de asuntos de seguridad disponibles públicamente. Se maneja por un numero único(Como el DNI) que es asignado por la Autoridad de Numeración CVE (CNA). Consiste en información crítica sobre una vulnerabilidad o exposición, incluyendo una descripción y referencias sobre el tema. Esto permite al equipo de TI de una organización entender el impacto potencial que podría tener una vulnerabilidad sobre su infraestructura.\n\nPara poder crear un CVE, este pasa por nueve etapas:\n\n\\- La primera identifica si el problema encontrado es una vulnerabilidad y, en el caso de existir, si esa vulnerabilidad no esta registrada antes\n\n\\- La segunda etapa consiste en asegurarse de que se tomaron las medidas necesarias\n\n\\- La tercera etapa, determina quién es el responsable (una empresa o un tercero).\n\n\\- La cuarta etapa, es la solicitud y el completado del formulario para el CVE.\n\n\\- La quinta es la confirmación del formulario\n\n\\- La sexta etapa se le asigna un ID.\n\n\\- La séptima se hace un anunciado a las partes implicadas para evitar danos antes de su divulgación publica.\n\n\\- La octava etapa es el anuncio del nuevo CVE \n\n\\- La novena, y ultima etapa, el equipo de CVE pide que el investigador ayude a proporcionar información adicional para ser utilizada en el listado oficial de CVE en la página web.\n\n\n\nAhora bien, cual es la relación entre OVAL y CVE? Simple, OVAL usa los identificadores CVE como referencia para crear definiciones que permiten escanear y verificar si una vulnerabilidad afecta o no a un sistema. CVE describe el fallo y como explotarlo, luego la comunidad publica una definición OVAl. Ejemplo: un CVE que afecta a Apache 2.4.49.\n\n\"Si el sistema tiene instalada la versión 2.4.49 de Apache, entonces está afectado por el CVE-2021-41773\".\n\n\n\nEspero que les guste el pequeño resumen que hice, la próxima vez voy a traerle información sobre la herramienta con la que estuve trabajando después de este estudio: Nessus\n\nQue la fuerza los acompañe!!\n\n ",

The server first verifies the existence of the user by performing a call to login_user_pass() with no password requirement. This will authenticate the session through the HMAC verification process and up until the server checks for user verification once more. The vulnerability can be further stabilized, eliminating the need for successfully triggering a race condition, by sending a mangled AWS4-HMAC header. By providing only the username and a following slash (/), the server will successfully find a username, which triggers the successful anypass authentication process, but the server will fail to find the expected SignedHeaders entry, resulting in an index-out-of-bounds error that stops the code from reaching the session cleanup. Together, these issues make it trivial to authenticate as any known or guessable user (e.g., crushadmin), and can lead to a full compromise of the system by obtaining an administrative account.\n\n- 📅 **Published:** 03/04/2025\n- 📈 **CVSS:** 9.8\n- 🧭 **Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\n- 📣 **Mentions:** 59\n- ⚠️ **Priority:** 2\n\n---\n\n**5.

    "text": "Host Rich Stroffolino will be chatting with our guest, **Nick Espinosa, host, The Deep Dive Radio Show** about some of the biggest stories in cybersecurity this past week. You are invited to watch and participate in the live discussion. \n\nWe go to air at 12:30pm PT/3:30pm ET. Just go to YouTube Live here [https://youtube.com/live/Zb2Oe9WaAKY](https://youtube.com/live/Zb2Oe9WaAKY) or you can [subscribe to the Cyber Security Headlines podcast](https://cisoseries.com/subscribe-podcast/) and get it into your feed.\n\nHere are the stories we plan to cover:\n\n**Hackers hijack Japanese financial accounts to conduct billions in trades**  \nJapan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) is warning of what they call a sharp increase in the number of cases of unauthorized access and unauthorized trading through online trading services in the first three months of 2025 with almost $2 billion in funds moved by hackers from 5,000 breached accounts. The FSA said, “hackers gain access to a victim’s account through stolen login information and use them to sell stocks or other securities.” As reported in The Record, “the hackers typically use the breached accounts to raise the price of smaller stocks that they themselves have purchased. Once the stock price increases, the hackers sell their stock and earn a profit from the inflated value.  \n([The Record](https://therecord.media/hackers-hijack-japan-finance-accounts))\n\n**Scientists use AI to encrypt secret messages that are invisible to cybersecurity systems**  \nResearchers from the University of Oslo have developed EmbedderLLM, a system that hides encrypted messages in AI-generated text, making them invisible to current cybersecurity tools. The technique embeds data into natural-sounding chatbot responses and can be sent via any messaging platform. It supports both symmetric and public-key encryption and is resistant to quantum decryption.  \n([Live Science](https://www.livescience.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/scientists-use-ai-to-encrypt-secret-messages-that-are-invisible-to-cybersecurity-systems))\n\n**Microsoft Teams will soon block screen capture during meetings**  \nMicrosoft will introduce a new “Prevent Screen Capture” feature in Teams starting July 2025, which will block users from taking screenshots of sensitive information during meetings. When a screenshot is attempted, the meeting window will turn black. Users joining from unsupported platforms will be restricted to audio-only mode to protect content. The feature will be available on Teams desktop apps (Windows and Mac) and mobile apps (iOS and Android). However, Microsoft notes that content can still be photographed externally. It remains unclear whether the feature will be enabled by default or controllable by meeting organizers or administrators.  \n([BleepingComputer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-teams-will-soon-block-screen-capture-during-meetings/))\n\n**Co-Op fears hackers still in the system, shelves getting empty**  \nAs part of the triumvirate of British retailer hacks, the Co-Operative chain, for familiarly known as the Co-Op, continues to deal with an attempted cyberattack detected two weeks ago. According to Recorded Future News, company officials “fear the hackers still have access to its network and is keeping some critical logistics systems offline, preventing shops from getting resupplied with many goods. As a result “deliveries from the Co-op’s large depots were well below 20% of their normal capacity,” especially wit regard to perishables such as meat, eggs, dairy, fruits and vegetables. As the company name describes, the company is owned by its members rather than being publicly listed, and as such is “not required to make any declaration to the London stock exchange about the expected adverse financial impact of the attack.”  \n([The Record](https://therecord.media/co-op-cyberattack-uk-company-fears-hackers-still-in-system))\n\n**UK launches software security guidelines**  \nThe UK’s National Cyber Security Centre and Department of Science, Innovation, and Technology published a voluntary Software Security Code of Practice last week. This code includes 14 principles across themes like secure design and development, build environment, deployment and maintenance, and customer communication. This echoes CISA Secure by Design principles in the US in many ways. At launch, the program is entirely voluntary and has no regulatory oversight, but the NCSC could adopt a certification program based on the standards in the future.  \n([Dark Reading](https://www.darkreading.com/application-security/uk-security-guidelines-boost-software-development))\n\n**IoT devices turned into proxy-for-rent service**  \nResearchers at Lumen’s Black Lotus Labs worked with the US DoJ, FBI, and the Dutch National Police to track a campaign based out of Turkey that targeted Internet of Things and end-of-life SOHO devices to create a botnet. Based out of Turkey, the network spread over 80 countries, with most botnet devices based in the US, Ecuador, and Canada. The operators claim the network contained over 7,000 active proxies per day, but researchers found this number closer to 1,000. The operators sold out network access for ad fraud, DDoS attacks, and credential stuffing. Lumen worked with law enforcement to disrupt the network by routing traffic through Lumen’s backbone.  \n([Infosecurity Magazine](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/proxy-network-infects-iot-devices/))\n\n**New Intel CPU flaws leak sensitive data from privileged memory**  \nAccording to researchers at ETH Zurich, “a new \"Branch Privilege Injection\" flaw in all modern Intel CPUs allows attackers to leak sensitive data from memory regions allocated to privileged software like the operating system kernel, along with critical data such as passwords, cryptographic keys, and memory of other processes. The branch privilege injection flaw which has a CVE-2024-45332 number available in the shownotes, belongs to “specialized hardware components that try to guess the outcome of a branch instruction before it's resolved to keep the CPU pipeline full for optimal performance.” BleepingComputer writes, “the risk is low for regular users, and attacks have multiple strong prerequisites to open up realistic exploitation scenarios. That being said, applying the latest updates is recommended.”  \n([BleepingComputer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-intel-cpu-flaws-leak-sensitive-data-from-privileged-memory/))\n\n**European Vulnerability Database (EUVD) is online**  \nThe European Union Agency for Cybersecurity, ENISA, announced in June 2024 that it would start work on the database as part of the EU’s Network and Information Security 2 Directive. A closed beta for the EUVD rolled out last month. Now a full version is available online. Like the US government’s National Vulnerability Database, the EUVD will identify disclosed vulnerabilities.

    "text": "Forgive me if this is a stupid question, but I am quite new in this field. \n\nI work in a medium sized company (200 people worldwide) and have been charged with being the main guy in charge of security. \n\nToday, in the M365 Defender portal, I saw two endpoints with alerts for \"an attempt at exploiting CVE-2020-0601 was detected\", one alert from March and the second one from today on my own PC. The events show nothing but point to a Microsoft root certificate and it's SHA1 hash.\n\nFrom my research I have found out this is related to certificate spoofing, but also that this exploit was fixed all the way back in 2020 through Windows Update. \n\nI guess I am struggling to understand what remediation steps I should take, or if I should even be taking these alerts seriously since it's already patched?\n\nI am mostly worried that this has happened twice and also somehow on my own PC, making me wonder if there could be something I am missing. \n\nWould really appreciate some thoughts or tips on this.",

[CVE-2025-31161](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-31161)**\n\n- 📝 CrushFTP 10 before 10.8.4 and 11 before 11.3.1 allows authentication bypass and takeover of the crushadmin account (unless a DMZ proxy instance is used), as exploited in the wild in March and April 2025, aka \"Unauthenticated HTTP(S) port access.\" A race condition exists in the AWS4-HMAC (compatible with S3) authorization method of the HTTP component of the FTP server. The server first verifies the existence of the user by performing a call to login_user_pass() with no password requirement. This will authenticate the session through the HMAC verification process and up until the server checks for user verification once more. The vulnerability can be further stabilized, eliminating the need for successfully triggering a race condition, by sending a mangled AWS4-HMAC header. By providing only the username and a following slash (/), the server will successfully find a username, which triggers the successful anypass authentication process, but the server will fail to find the expected SignedHeaders entry, resulting in an index-out-of-bounds error that stops the code from reaching the session cleanup. Together, these issues make it trivial to authenticate as any known or guessable user (e.g., crushadmin), and can lead to a full compromise of the system by obtaining an administrative account.\n\n- 📅 **Published:** 03/04/2025\n- 📈 **CVSS:** 9.8\n- 🧭 **Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\n- 📣 **Mentions:** 59\n- ⚠️ **Priority:** 2\n\n---\n\n**5.

The update, quoting the changelog, only brings the security patch update to April 2025, nothing more nothing less. So I downloaded the full package (5+Gb), followed the guide in the LineageOS wiki for \"[Update firmware on OnePlus 9 Pro](https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/lemonadep/fw_update)\", turned on the phone and used it as usual for few days.\n\nHere comes the problem, I made two video calls on WhatsApp (in two separate days) one came to 20 min, the other to 30 min, but out of nowhere the phone crashes. It doesn't reboot, but a black screen appears with various sayings about RAM and dumps.  \nThe screen seems to be called \"**XBLRamDump**\", but online I couldn't find anything but a [CVE-2017-13238](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2017-13238/).\n\nI couldn't take a picture of the screen because I didn't have any other devices to do it with at the time, but if it's not a known thing and it might help, I'll try to reproduce the problem and take a picture.\n\nP.S. I checked the firmware update and all binaries are flashed without any problems.",

The server first verifies the existence of the user by performing a call to login_user_pass() with no password requirement. This will authenticate the session through the HMAC verification process and up until the server checks for user verification once more. The vulnerability can be further stabilized, eliminating the need for successfully triggering a race condition, by sending a mangled AWS4-HMAC header. By providing only the username and a following slash (/), the server will successfully find a username, which triggers the successful anypass authentication process, but the server will fail to find the expected SignedHeaders entry, resulting in an index-out-of-bounds error that stops the code from reaching the session cleanup. Together, these issues make it trivial to authenticate as any known or guessable user (e.g., crushadmin), and can lead to a full compromise of the system by obtaining an administrative account.\n\n- 📅 **Published:** 03/04/2025\n- 📈 **CVSS:** 9.8\n- 🧭 **Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\n- 📣 **Mentions:** 59\n- ⚠️ **Priority:** 2\n\n---\n\n**5.

(And when you wonder why I would still go to the level of using Uber OR Lyft--be in an unwalkable area that your job transferred you to that would take 4.5 hours to walk home from--I took the bus.. a lot.) \n\nI think the Apple security breach is CVE-2025-21391, it was January/February it was discovered, few people believed the guy who just wanted the breach to stop. But the 3 point patch Apple released only patched ONE of the problems. And I believe there were more. Basically code continuing to overwrite code due to what should have simplified actual phone use if not for bad actors.\n\nI have had issues with 5/3 bank, SoFi, my local police, Uber, Lyft, Target, Expedia... and nothing was returned. I am just lucky my job still loves me... but it might be why they are fixing certain things because... how does someone stalk you nearly daily to a place of employment?? (And when you wonder how I didn't notice--I sort of did, but 1-everything was always pending and 2-I relied on my apps, which would likely have been compromised so it wasn't until I went back to paper statements.)\n\nAnyone with advice or experience, love to hear and not feel alone (",

[CVE-2025-31161](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-31161)**\n\n- 📝 CrushFTP 10 before 10.8.4 and 11 before 11.3.1 allows authentication bypass and takeover of the crushadmin account (unless a DMZ proxy instance is used), as exploited in the wild in March and April 2025, aka \"Unauthenticated HTTP(S) port access.\" A race condition exists in the AWS4-HMAC (compatible with S3) authorization method of the HTTP component of the FTP server. The server first verifies the existence of the user by performing a call to login_user_pass() with no password requirement. This will authenticate the session through the HMAC verification process and up until the server checks for user verification once more. The vulnerability can be further stabilized, eliminating the need for successfully triggering a race condition, by sending a mangled AWS4-HMAC header. By providing only the username and a following slash (/), the server will successfully find a username, which triggers the successful anypass authentication process, but the server will fail to find the expected SignedHeaders entry, resulting in an index-out-of-bounds error that stops the code from reaching the session cleanup. Together, these issues make it trivial to authenticate as any known or guessable user (e.g., crushadmin), and can lead to a full compromise of the system by obtaining an administrative account.\n\n- 📅 **Published:** 03/04/2025\n- 📈 **CVSS:** 9.8\n- 🧭 **Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\n- 📣 **Mentions:** 60\n- ⚠️ **Priority:** 2\n\n---\n\n**5.

    "title": "Omni security notification - potential data security issue.",
    "text": "All our omni customers received a security notification today. This seems like a pretty serious issue, especially if you're exposing omni externally. The email came from Salesforce, so not phishing. I can't find this documented anywhere else though.\n\nLuckily none of our customers expose data externally via omni, but I'd be worried if they did. \n\n**Here's the high level summary (done by AI):**\n\nFive security vulnerabilities were discovered in OmniStudio's FlexCard and Data Mapper components (versions before Spring '25/254) that allow unauthorized access to data by bypassing security controls.\n\nRequired Action: Either update to version 254+ or apply specific configuration flags to enforce proper security checks. Workarounds are available if updating isn't possible.\n\nPotential Impact: Users without proper permissions may have been able to view encrypted data or fields they shouldn't have access to.\n\n_____________________________\nThe email content is below:\n\nAppOmni, a Salesforce research partner, recently discovered CVEs 2025-43698, 2025-43700, 2025-43701, 2025-43699 and 2025-43697, which impact the Flexcard and Data Mapper components of Omnistudio (for both Core and managed packages).\n\nDataMapper CVE (impacting OmniStudio versions prior to Spring '25/version 254):\n\n    CVE-2025-43697: If ‘Check Field Level Security’ is not enabled for ‘Extract’ and ‘Turbo Extract’ Data Mappers, the ‘View Encrypted Data’ permission check is not enforced, exposing cleartext values for the encrypted fields to users with access to a given record. \n\nFlexcard CVEs (impacting OmniStudio versions prior to Spring '25/version 254):\n\n    CVE-2025-43698: The SOQL data source bypasses any Field-Level Security when fetching data from Salesforce objects.\n    CVE-2025-43699: Flexcard does not enforce the ‘Required Permissions’ field for the OmniUICard object.\n    CVE-2025-43700: Flexcard does not enforce the ‘View Encrypted Data’ permission, returning plaintext values for data that uses Classic Encryption.\n    CVE-2025-43701: Allows Guest Users to access values for Custom Settings. \n\n**What action do I need to take?**\n\nYou must take the following actions to address the CVEs impacting the Flexcard and Data Mapper components:\n\n   To ensure that configurations related to Field-Level Security are enforced when SOQL/SOSL Flexcard queries are run, enable the flag “EnableQueryWithFLS” in the Omni Interaction configuration.\n\n\nPlease note that customers with managed packages on a version of Omnistudio prior to Spring ‘25/version 254 will need to update to version 254 or 256 in order to use the flag. If you cannot update, you can ensure that field-level access configurations and permissions are enforced by adding \"WITH USER_MODE\" to the SOSL/SOQL queries configured in your Flexcards. \n\nTo prevent Data Mappers from returning encrypted data in cleartext format, enable the “EnforceDMFLSAndDataEncryption” flag in the Omni Interaction configuration. Please note that once this flag is enabled, users will need the permission “View Encrypted Data” to access the contents of Classic Encrypted fields.\n\nPlease note that customers with managed packages on a version of Omnistudio prior to Spring ‘25/version 254 will need to update to version 254 or 256 in order to use the flag. If you cannot update, you can ensure that the “View Encrypted Data” permission check is enforced by manually enabling “Check Field Level Security” for each Data Mapper. \n\n**What steps can I take to confirm if sensitive data was exposed prior to updating or applying the manual fixes?**\n\nTo confirm whether sensitive data was potentially exposed to unauthorized users, review Flexcards that were exposed to Community Sites and used SOQL/SOSL datasource types, or implemented actions that require SOQL/SOSL queries. Users with access to the records associated with these Flexcards would have been able to view values for all the fields regardless of whether they had field-level access or permission to view encrypted fields.\n\nWe also suggest that you review your implementation to confirm if A) any ‘Extract’ or ‘Turbo Extract’ Data Mappers were fetching encrypted fields, and B) if the “Check Field Level Security” option was disabled for the Data Mapper. If both of these conditions were met, then any encrypted fields in that Data Mapper were potentially viewable to users with access to a given record.",

[CVE-2025-31161](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-31161)**\n\n- 📝 CrushFTP 10 before 10.8.4 and 11 before 11.3.1 allows authentication bypass and takeover of the crushadmin account (unless a DMZ proxy instance is used), as exploited in the wild in March and April 2025, aka \"Unauthenticated HTTP(S) port access.\" A race condition exists in the AWS4-HMAC (compatible with S3) authorization method of the HTTP component of the FTP server. The server first verifies the existence of the user by performing a call to login_user_pass() with no password requirement. This will authenticate the session through the HMAC verification process and up until the server checks for user verification once more. The vulnerability can be further stabilized, eliminating the need for successfully triggering a race condition, by sending a mangled AWS4-HMAC header. By providing only the username and a following slash (/), the server will successfully find a username, which triggers the successful anypass authentication process, but the server will fail to find the expected SignedHeaders entry, resulting in an index-out-of-bounds error that stops the code from reaching the session cleanup. Together, these issues make it trivial to authenticate as any known or guessable user (e.g., crushadmin), and can lead to a full compromise of the system by obtaining an administrative account.\n\n- 📅 **Published:** 03/04/2025\n- 📈 **CVSS:** 9.8\n- 🧭 **Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\n- 📣 **Mentions:** 61\n- ⚠️ **Priority:** 2\n\n---\n\n**6.

    "article_text": "vLLM, an inference and serving engine for large language models (LLMs), has an issue in versions 0.6.5 through 0.8.4 that ONLY impacts environments using the `PyNcclPipe` KV cache transfer integration with the V0 engine. No other configurations are affected. vLLM supports the use of the `PyNcclPipe` class to establish a peer-to-peer communication domain for data transmission between distributed nodes. The GPU-side KV-Cache transmission is implemented through the `PyNcclCommunicator` class, while CPU-side control message passing is handled via the `send_obj` and `recv_obj` methods on the CPU side.​ The intention was that this interface should only be exposed to a private network using the IP address specified by the `–kv-ip` CLI parameter. The vLLM documentation covers how this must be limited to a secured network. The default and intentional behavior from PyTorch is that the `TCPStore` interface listens on ALL interfaces, regardless of what IP address is provided. The IP address given was only used as a client-side address to use. vLLM was fixed to use a workaround to force the `TCPStore` instance to bind its socket to a specified private interface. As of version 0.8.5, vLLM limits the `TCPStore` socket to the private interface as configured.",

Prior to version 2.0.8, the `ejson2env` tool has a vulnerability related to how it writes to `stdout`. Specifically, the tool is intended to write an export statement for environment variables and their values. However, due to inadequate output sanitization, there is a potential risk where variable names or values may include malicious content, resulting in additional unintended commands being output to `stdout`. If this output is improperly utilized in further command execution, it could lead to command injection, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the host system. Version 2.0.8 sanitizes output during decryption. Other mitigations involve avoiding use of `ejson2env` to decrypt untrusted user secrets and/or avoiding evaluating or executing the direct output from `ejson2env` without removing nonprintable characters.",

This white paper will describe how MS-RPC security research can be automated using a fuzzing methodology to identify interesting RPC interfaces and procedures.\n\n  \nBy following this approach, a security researcher will hopefully identify interesting RPC services in such a time that would take a manual approach significantly more. And so, the tool was put to the test. Using the tool, I was able to discover 9 new vulnerabilities within the Windows operating system. One of the vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-26651), allowed crashing the Local Session Manager service remotely. \n\n  \n",

    "text": "Hey folks 👋\n\nWe’re living in what can only be described as an **AI renaissance**. New tools drop daily, models are evolving at breakneck speed, and even hardware giants are jumping on the AI train. But here’s the million-dollar question:\n\n>\n\nLet’s unpack some of the biggest shifts happening right now — and what they might mean for devs, startups, and society at large:\n\n# 🔍 Search Is Dead. Long Live AI Interfaces.\n\nGoogle just unveiled its **AI Mode in Search**, and it's a sign of the times. Traditional 10-blue-links search is being replaced by **generative, contextual results**. That means:\n\n* Less SEO reliance\n* More content summarization\n* A future where *clicking links may be optional*\n\nAre content creators and site owners prepared for this shift?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bcq778cpfc2f1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba28efc973bece2a71ffbb704f43ce8134aeeaee\n\n# 📱 Hardware Gets an AI Upgrade\n\nOpenAI's $6.5B acquisition of **Jony Ive's AI startup** signals a pivot to **AI-first devices**. Think beyond smartphones — we're talking about:\n\n* Wearables that think with you\n* Always-on AI assistants\n* Smart home interfaces that *don’t feel dumb*\n\nWill these replace phones? Or just make them smarter?\n\n# 🤖 Autonomous Agents Need Real Security\n\nThe recent discovery of **CVE-2025-47241**, a zero-click exploit in Browser Use frameworks, shows how vulnerable today's LLM-powered agents are.  \nIf AI agents are:\n\n* Browsing the web\n* Making decisions\n* Acting on your behalf…\n\n...then **sandboxing, threat modeling, and auditing** must become default — not an afterthought.\n\n# 🌍 AI Is Tackling Climate, Medicine, and More\n\nNot all news is scary. Some of the most inspiring updates this week:\n\n* **Aurora**, a weather AI by Penn & Microsoft, outperforms traditional forecasts\n* **Persist AI** raised $12M to streamline drug development\n* **Bezos Earth Fund** is backing AI for conservation and climate\n\nThis is the kind of tech we need *more* of — real-world, high-impact AI.\n\n# 🔮 Final Thought\n\nThe AI hype is justified. But it’s time we stop treating AI tools like toys and start thinking like architects of the future.\n\nSo — what do you think?\n\n* Are we innovating responsibly?\n* Which tool or breakthrough impressed you most this week?\n* What *hasn’t* been built yet that we desperately need?\n\nLet's chat 👇\n\n✉️ For more tools, trends & deep dives soon: [**www.best-ai-tools.org**](https://www.best-ai-tools.org)  \n💬 Follow us here for daily updates!",

[CVE-2025-31161](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-31161)**\n\n- 📝 CrushFTP 10 before 10.8.4 and 11 before 11.3.1 allows authentication bypass and takeover of the crushadmin account (unless a DMZ proxy instance is used), as exploited in the wild in March and April 2025, aka \"Unauthenticated HTTP(S) port access.\" A race condition exists in the AWS4-HMAC (compatible with S3) authorization method of the HTTP component of the FTP server. The server first verifies the existence of the user by performing a call to login_user_pass() with no password requirement. This will authenticate the session through the HMAC verification process and up until the server checks for user verification once more. The vulnerability can be further stabilized, eliminating the need for successfully triggering a race condition, by sending a mangled AWS4-HMAC header. By providing only the username and a following slash (/), the server will successfully find a username, which triggers the successful anypass authentication process, but the server will fail to find the expected SignedHeaders entry, resulting in an index-out-of-bounds error that stops the code from reaching the session cleanup. Together, these issues make it trivial to authenticate as any known or guessable user (e.g., crushadmin), and can lead to a full compromise of the system by obtaining an administrative account.\n\n- 📅 **Published:** 03/04/2025\n- 📈 **CVSS:** 9.8\n- 🧭 **Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\n- 📣 **Mentions:** 61\n- ⚠️ **Priority:** 2\n\n---\n\n**6.

    "title": "WARNING: using the drivetemp kernel module on Unraid versions prior to 7.0.1 may damage your array",
    "text": "Over the past few days, I started using a new temperature monitoring and fan control software, [CoolerControl](https://docs.coolercontrol.org/) (available on the CA), sidenote, it's a great piece of software, highly recommended. I wanted to expose the drive temps to it in order to control the fans for my drive cage, so I enabled the drivetemp kernel module so that would work. Unfortunately, there was a bug in drivetemp for \\~5 years:\n\n[https://lore.kernel.org/linux-cve-announce/2025012131-CVE-2025-21656-b967@gregkh/T/#u](https://lore.kernel.org/linux-cve-announce/2025012131-CVE-2025-21656-b967@gregkh/T/#u)\n\nThis bug causes errors returned by SCSI commands to push \"garbage data\" to the system, and in my case broke parity numerous times. It's likely, but not certain, that this would only occur when using a SAS HBA as the bug is specifically related to SCSI commands (note, you do not need to be using actual SCSI drives for those commands to be used). The errors were being produced when a drive would spin up. I think the driver considers the timeouts while it waits for a HDD to spin up an \"error\", thus every time it checks if the drive is ready, it throws an error if the drive *isn't* ready. Ordinarily, that would be fine, but because of the bug, that error, for me, would create tons more errors on the system. As I mentioned, drives dropped out of my array multiple times resulting in several parity rebuilds. If the drive is spinning up for a read, it's probably not *too* dangerous for the array, but I think if the drive was spinning up for writes, this bug could potentially corrupt data.\n\nI want to reiterate that this bug was **in the kernel**, so it was not the fault of CoolerControl (edit: or Unraid, for that matter). Fortunately, it was fixed in kernel version 6.6.72 earlier this year. If you intend on using CoolerControl with this kernel module enabled (or enabling it for any other reason), **ensure you are using Unraid 7.0.1 or later where the bug has been fixed.**",

We have a constraint in that we're still running some server 2012 RDSH farms (Yes i know, i know.

    "text": "\n**Serious authentication bypass vulnerabilities in KUNBUS's Revolution Pi devices could allow remote attackers to take control of industrial systems.**\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n- KUNBUS Revolution Pi devices face critical authentication bypass vulnerabilities.\n- Attackers can exploit these flaws to execute commands remotely, compromising safety systems.\n- Recommendations include immediate software updates and network isolation to mitigate risks.\n\nCISA has issued a critical advisory regarding alarming vulnerabilities found in KUNBUS GmbH’s Revolution Pi industrial automation devices. These vulnerabilities, specifically an authentication bypass and remote code execution risks, could expose vital sectors like manufacturing, energy, and healthcare to severe threats. The potential for attackers to disrupt essential operations, manipulate safety systems, or inflict widespread downtime serves as a stark reminder of the urgency of cybersecurity measures in industrial settings.\n\nThe advisory outlines three significant vulnerabilities with extremely high severity scores. The most concerning, CVE-2025-24522, highlights a lack of default authentication in the Node-RED server, enabling unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary commands with complete control over the industrial systems. Other vulnerabilities, such as CVE-2025-32011 and CVE-2025-24524, allow attackers to bypass authentication mechanisms and inject scripts, respectively, potentially leading to devastating consequences. Even though KUNBUS has acknowledged these risks and released patches, many organizations remain vulnerable due to slow update cycles, particularly in regulated environments where legacy systems are still in use.\n\nWhat steps is your organization taking to address potential vulnerabilities in industrial control systems?\n\n**Learn More:** [Cyber Security News](https://cybersecuritynews.com/kunbus-auth-bypass-vulnerabilities/)\n\n**Want to stay updated on the latest cyber threats?** \n\n 👉 **[Subscribe to /r/PwnHub](https://www.reddit.com/r/pwnhub)**",

The fix will introduce notable performance penalties on Intel machines (30-35%).\n>\n>People have noticed a recent development in the Linux kernel: a rather massive, important redesign (page table isolation) is being introduced very fast for kernel standards... and being backported! The \"official\" reason is to incorporate a mitigation called KASLR... which most security experts consider almost useless. There's also some unusual, suspicious stuff going on: the documentation is missing, some of the comments are redacted (https://twitter.com/grsecurity/status/947147105684123649) and people with Intel, Amazon and Google emails are CC'd.\n>\n>According to one of the people working on it, PTI is only needed for Intel CPUs, AMD is not affected by whatever it protects against (https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/12/27/2). PTI affects a core low-level feature (virtual memory) and as severe performance penalties: 29% for an i7-6700 and 34% for an i7-3770S, according to Brad Spengler from grsecurity. PTI is simply not active for AMD CPUs. The kernel flag is named X86_BUG_CPU_INSECURE and its description is \"CPU is insecure and needs kernel page table isolation\".\n>\n>Microsoft has been silently working on a similar feature since November: https://twitter.com/aionescu/status/930412525111296000\n>\n>People are speculating on a possible massive Intel CPU hardware bug that directly opens up serious vulnerabilities on big cloud providers which offer shared hosting (several VMs on a single host), for example by letting a VM read from or write to another one.\n\n**NOTE**: the examples of the i7 series, are just examples. This affects all Intel platforms as far as I can tell.\n\n**THANKS**: Thank you for the gold /u/tipsle!\n\n***Benchmarks***\n\n*This was tested on an i6700k, just so you have a feel for the processor this was performed on.*\n\n* *Syscall test*: Thanks to Aiber for the synthetic test on Linux with the latest patches. Doing tasks that require a lot of syscalls will see the most performance hit. Compiling, virtualization, etc. Whether day to day usage, gaming, etc will be affected remains to be seen. But as you can see below, up to 4x slower speeds with the patches...\n\n[Test Results](https://paste.ubuntu.com/26316759/)\n\n* *iperf test*: Adding another test from Aiber. There are some differences, but not hugely significant.\n\n[Test Results](https://paste.ubuntu.com/26316783/)\n\n* Phoronix pre/post patch testing underway [here](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=linux-415-x86pti&num=1)    \n\n* Gaming doesn't seem to be affected at this time. See [here](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=x86-PTI-Initial-Gaming-Tests)\n\n* Nvidia gaming slightly affected by patches. See [here](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=nvidia-linux-kpti&num=1)\n\n* Phoronix VM benchmarks [here](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=linux-kpti-kvm&num=1)\n\n***Patches***\n\n* AMD patch excludes their processor(s) from the Intel patch [here](https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/12/27/2). It's waiting to be merged. **UPDATE**: [Merged](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=00a5ae218d57741088068799b810416ac249a9ce&utm_source=anz)\n\n***News***\n\n* PoC of the bug in action [here](https://twitter.com/brainsmoke/status/948561799875502080)\n\n* Google's [response](https://security.googleblog.com/2018/01/todays-cpu-vulnerability-what-you-need.html?m=1). This is much bigger than anticipated...\n\n* Amazon's [response](https://aws.amazon.com/security/security-bulletins/AWS-2018-013/)\n\n* Intel's [response](https://newsroom.intel.com/news/intel-responds-to-security-research-findings/). This was partially correct info from Intel... AMD claims it is not affected by this issue... See below for AMD's responses\n\n* [Verge story](https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/3/16846784/microsoft-processor-bug-windows-10-fix) with Microsoft statement\n\n* [The Register's article](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/01/02/intel_cpu_design_flaw/)\n\n* AMD's response to Intel via [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/03/amd-rebukes-intel-says-flaw-poses-near-zero-risk-to-its-chips.html)\n\n* AMD's response to Intel via [Twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/ryanshrout/status/948683677244018689)\n\n***Security Bulletins/Articles***\n\n* [Meltdown/Sceptre](https://meltdownattack.com/)\n\n* Redhat's [bulletin](https://access.redhat.com/security/vulnerabilities/speculativeexecution)\n\n* VMware's [bulletin](https://lists.vmware.com/pipermail/security-announce/2018/000397.html)\n\n* Microsoft's [bulletin](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/ADV180002)\n\n* Xen's [bulletin](https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-254.html)\n\n* Citrix's [bulletin](https://support.citrix.com/article/CTX231399)\n\n* ARM's [bulletin](https://developer.arm.com/support/security-update)\n\n* Debian's [bulletin](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5754)\n\n* Ubuntu's [article](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/KnowledgeBase/SpectreAndMeltdown)\n\n* Suse's [article](https://www.suse.com/c/suse-addresses-meltdown-spectre-vulnerabilities/)\n\n* LLVM's [bulletin](http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-commits/Week-of-Mon-20180101/513630.html)\n\n* Google's [bulletin](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.co.at/2018/01/reading-privileged-memory-with-side.html)\n\n* Nvidia's [bulletin](https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/4611)\n\n***Post Patch News***\n\n* Epic games struggling after applying patches [here](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/forums/news/announcements/132642-epic-services-stability-update)\n\n* Ubisoft rumors of server issues after patching their servers [here](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/multiple-ubisoft-games-having-server-issues-on-ps4/1100-6455933/).

Used to be able to boot 30 VDI's at once, can only boot 10 at once now. *To think, I still have to patch all the guests on top still...*",

    "title": "Clearing up misconceptions about the ALGS hack",
    "text": "Some background to establish credibility: I work in cybersecurity as a [white hat hacker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_hat_(computer_security)). I've been losing my mind reading some of the misinformation which has been being spread about the ALGS hack so here's a quick list of clarifications.\n\n# What happened?\n\nHal and Gen both had cheats toggled on by a hacker, mid-ALGS game. On Gen's screen, a cheat menu of some sort popped up: [https://www.twitch.tv/genburten/clip/SparklingDarlingApeKlappa-iYd-e5Nns\\_gMcGuv](https://www.twitch.tv/genburten/clip/SparklingDarlingApeKlappa-iYd-e5Nns_gMcGuv)\n\n# How did this happen?\n\nThe short answer is **nobody knows for sure at this point**. Anybody other than someone on Respawn's incident response team or the hacker themselves who claims to know *for certain* what happened is not telling the truth. However, here are some possibilities for how this might have happened:\n\n# Phishing\n\nIf both Hal and Gen were tricked into downloading malware onto their computer, that malware could obviously contain cheats which the hacker could then activate during a game. This type of attack is called [phishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing). I believe this to be the less likely scenario, for reasons I mention in the next section, but it is absolutely possible.\n\n# Remote code execution\n\nRCE is a type of vulnerability in which an attacker is able to get code running on a computer remotely (i.e., over the internet). If an attacker were to find an RCE, they would be able to put cheat software onto Hal and Gen's computers and cause it to execute. They would also allow the attacker to do considerably more malicious things, like stealing personal data from the computer (passwords, etc.), installing [ransomware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransomware) (which encrypts all your files and tries to force you to pay a ransom to get them back), etc. As a result, this is something of a nightmare scenario. RCE is a very severe vulnerability in any context.\n\nUnfortunately, it's also the more likely scenario, in my opinion. From what I can tell, the hacker behind this attack has a history of developing advanced cheats, meaning they're technically proficient and familiar with the security measures of both the Apex client and servers. The hacker themselves has also [claimed that this is an RCE](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1009463818105135145/1219099826298290196/image.png?ex=660a1230&is=65f79d30&hm=df7abcdabff175896c7a1878a6569e78152aecc668f6f49e1a1a7d64e8c82a95&) (source: coldjyn), but tbh I think they would claim this for clout regardless of whether they actually had an RCE or not.\n\nIf you would like to learn more about RCE in general, here's a short overview: [https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/remote-code-execution-rce/](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/remote-code-execution-rce/)\n\n# Have games had RCEs before?\n\nApex specifically has not had any publicly known RCEs, but plenty of other games have had RCEs discovered in the past. This includes [CSGO](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cs-go-valve-source-games-vulnerable-to-hacking-using-steam-invites/), [the entire Dark Souls series](https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/22/22896785/dark-souls-3-remote-execution-exploit-rce-exploit-online-hack), [Minecraft](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/minecraft-rushes-out-patch-for-critical-log4j-vulnerability/), and [a whole bunch of Call of Duty games](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-20817).\n\n# Am I in danger if I play Apex?\n\nMaybe. **I personally have uninstalled Apex to be safe right now, and think you should do the same if you are on PC.** Although the odds that you specifically will be targeted with an RCE out of several million Apex players are fairly low, I would recommend not taking that risk. Avoid EA games for a couple days until Respawn/EA at least put out a statement about the incident, and give some indication of the severity of it.\n\nMinor edit: As some have pointed out in the replies, if you leave Apex installed and just don't open it you'll probably be fine as well.\n\n# Some common misconceptions\n\n* \"This was done with Webhooks.\" I can confidently say that this is nonsense and [the person who tweeted it](https://twitter.com/xDesk23/status/1769527262896964059) is talking out of their ass. Webhooks are generally unrelated to what the vast majority of online games use for connections from the client to the server. It's maybe theoretically possible that for some cursed reason Apex uses webhooks for *something*, but it is extremely unlikely that the vulnerability is actually a webhook thing, and frankly from the way the source of this info wrote their Tweet I have zero confidence that they know what they are talking about.\n* \"This is an Easy Anticheat issue.\" While this is certainly *possible*, there's nowhere near enough information to be able to tell if this is the case or not. Anything people say is at this point just speculation. The same goes for \"This is an R5 issue,\" \"This is an Apex client issue,\" \"This is an Apex server issue,\" \"This is a Source Engine issue,\" etc. It is too early to tell where the vulnerability is. The only one of these that I have a somewhat confident take about is R5, which I think is fairly unlikely to be the attack vector here. However, that is just my personal opinion.\n   * Update: EAC has [stated](https://twitter.com/TeddyEAC/status/1769725032047972566) that they conducted an investigation and are \"confident that there is no RCE vulnerability within EAC being exploited.\"\n* \"Apex uses remote code execution.\" RCE is a vulnerability/bug, not a feature. If there is RCE in Apex, it is caused by a flaw rather than there by design.\n* \"This wouldn't be an issue if Apex had root/kernel-level anticheat.\" Easy AntiCheat is root-level.\n* \"This is an issue because of root-level anticheat.\" It is possible to securely implement a root-level anticheat. An anticheat being root-level does not create RCE; it makes it so that in the event of an RCE, the impact is higher. This is why Riot, creators of Vanguard, have a fairly generous [bug bounty program for Vanguard](https://hackerone.com/riot?type=team). They know that having Vanguard be secure is critically important, so they offer $100k to researchers who discover and report vulnerabilities in it.\n* \"This is because of the ALGS client.\" The ALGS client no longer exists; players play on their normal client and account.\n* \"The hack works through friend requests.\" Once again, this is possible but purely speculation at the moment. Same goes for all the other theories floating around (hacking through gifts, observers, the server itself, etc.)\n* \"This can't happen on LAN.\" A little-known fact is that Apex LANs are not actually on a local network, despite the name. They just have a dedicated server somewhere nearby lol. So it's possible that this could have happened at a LAN event as well. I have heard pros [mention](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2094050654?t=0h55m5s) that at LAN they are forced to tinker with certain files to get the queueing to work, but I do not know what this entails or whether this is sufficient to isolate the game clients from the open internet.\n\n# Other takeaways\n\nIt has long been my belief that video game companies need to take security far more seriously than they currently are. Despite making systems as complicated as many \"normal\" tech companies, many game companies don't even have security teams and do not subject their systems to sufficient security auditing. The reason for this is often that executives are unwilling to invest money into security until a major incident happens, because there is not an immediately apparent profit from it. Security teams don't make a product that you can sell to people, so many executives view them as a money pit.\n\nI don't know if this is the case at Respawn, but I would not be surprised. From some cursory googling, I wasn't able to find a CISO (Chief Information Security Officer). Their existing security team seems to be primarily focused on anti-cheating measures. I can't find any bug bounty programs or even a vulnerability disclosure process apart from the broader one handled by EA. My takeaway from this is: **Please do not harass random Respawn developers about this incident.** If this whole thing is indeed an RCE, that's most likely the result of structural or managerial failures at Respawn rather than because the developers just didn't work hard enough. **Every time I've tested a product with bad security, it has been because the team behind it was underfunded, understaffed, etc.**",

        "text": "I think it's likely you don't need the victim IP to carry out this attack.\nI've seen something similar a few years ago on Photon, a unity networking library. Using Photon there were multiple ways to do all sorts of things by:\n1. Abusing unsecure RPC endpoints implemented by the game creators.\n2. Finding and abusing a vulnerability on the library/server side to relay corrupted packets.\n\nBoth of them work using the Photon identifier shared in the whole lobby (this also happens in Apex for sure, you need it to distinguish between players) and then the server relays the RPC messages to the user.\n\nIn apex is likely different but the same principles applies, for every game functionality you can do something and when you do you send a packet to the server and the server relays it to everyone else/the ones affected. When the other clients receive the event they run their handler and if the handler has some vulnerability you might be able to trick the server into relaying a crafted message that abuses the handler vulnerability.\n\nExpanding on the vulnarabilities on the unity games that use Photon:\n\nIn case of 1. you could abuse methods implemented for general game functionality and call them whenever you wanted to break the game state for that user, it was easy to crash someone game by spamming some RPC that created objects or similar. They were usually protected by checks to see if you were the host of the lobby but not always. (Also often you had some way to become the host of the lobby).\n\nIn case of 2. there were a series of exploits that were used to crash people and were way harder to patch by other modders, for example one was abusing a bug in how Photon comunicated, you could send a message to arbitrary users (one-to-many) and Photon accepts a list of recipients, but you could put the same user 1k times and Photon would try to send 1k packets to them before disconnecting them from their servers. Another one was abusing a vulnerability in the library packet decoder to brick the game and block all network communication until you restarted the game.",

    "title": "Google's botched Pixel 6 update and the Android security patch conundrum",
    "text": "Google has rolled out a monthly security update for its Pixel phones at the beginning of each month for the last several years. The January 2022 update for Pixel phones started rolling out on Tuesday, but Google’s latest Pixel phones — the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro — won’t be receiving the update until later this month. A couple of weeks of delay doesn’t sound like a big deal, but Google previously [halted](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/143183382/december-2021-update-paused) and [pulled](https://9to5google.com/2022/01/04/google-delists-december-2021-update-pixel-6-pro/) the big December 2021 update before it rolled out for most Pixel 6 users — meaning most users are running a build that’s two months out of date (and potentially [getting their enterprise access revoked](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/rxiv5r/enterprise_account_disabled_due_to_update_fiasco/)). Considering that the January 2022 update fixes the [very serious emergency calling bug](https://medium.com/@mmrahman123/how-a-bug-in-android-and-microsoft-teams-could-have-caused-this-users-911-call-to-fail-6525f9ba5e63), it’s a bit worrying that the update has been delayed!   \n\nI think it’s fair to say that Google strives to roll out updates as quickly as possible for its own Pixel phones, and indeed no one can argue that Google is slow at rolling out updates. Perhaps the combination of the winter holidays, the laundry list of changes to merge from [the first Android 12 Quarterly Platform Release](https://www.esper.io/blog/android-dessert-bites-4-powered-by-esper), the switch to developing for its in-house Tensor platform, and carrier testing and retesting resulted in the one-week delay and eventual cancellation of the December 2021 update and the multi-week delay of the January 2021 update. It’s normal for some bugs to go unnoticed before an update goes out, because it’s impossible to catch every issue in the brief time they have to test. Nevertheless, this delay highlights a flaw in how Google handles Android’s monthly security patches, so in this post, I’ll be diving into the monthly security patch process and identify an area where Google could do better.  \n\n##The monthly Android Security Bulletin is always on time, even if updates aren’t  \n\nCompared to Chrome and Chrome OS, Google has far less control over the distribution of Android. Google has to work more closely with OEMs, who fork AOSP to add their own software features and branding, and SoC vendors, who write the closed source drivers that enable hardware components. Rather than submitting patches for security vulnerabilities to the public AOSP repository and waiting for OEMs to merge them, Google created the monthly Android Security Bulletin (ASB) to coordinate the disclosure of security vulnerabilities and give companies time to merge and test security patches before public disclosure.  \n\nAn Android Security Bulletin has been published every month since August of 2015. Generally, the Bulletin goes public on the first Monday of every month, unless that Monday falls on a holiday observed by Google, in which case the ASB goes public on the next business day. By coordinating the disclosure of security vulnerabilities with OEMs and SoC vendors and privately sharing the patches one month in advance of public disclosure, Google is able to speed up the uptake of security patches and minimize harm to users. The more time that companies have to integrate and test security patches, the faster they’re able to roll out an update with those patches. The less time that hackers have to analyze and exploit the newly discovered security vulnerabilities, the fewer number of users that can be attacked.  \n\nWhile you can predict when the next ASB will go live, you generally can’t predict when the software update with those patches will roll out. Google almost always rolls out an update on the same day the ASB goes live, though that obviously hasn’t been the case for the Pixel 6 series since its release. When it comes to most OEMs, the update may roll out weeks or months after public disclosure, but some of the faster OEMs push out updates within days. Google doesn’t like it when OEMs roll out updates too quickly, curiously enough. Essential’s former head of R&D, Jason Keats, told [*Android Police*](https://www.androidpolice.com/osom-ov1-exclusive/#:~:text=When%20it%20came%20to%20monthly%20security%20updates%20on%20the%20Essential%20PH%2D1) that the company was berated for pushing updates out too fast. “Literally, we would get yelled at by Google for being too fast… they would then say, ‘We will not allow you to push your update until the Pixel team is ready,’” said Keats in the interview. Dianne Hackborn, one of the most senior engineers on the Android team, [offered an explanation](https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1473445076856676356/photo/1) for why Google disapproves of updates being pushed out by other companies on day one. According to her, security updates are pushed to Pixels only when they’re sufficiently tested to show no problems, so if other companies are pushing out updates before Google, then they may be doing so before the patches have been fully tested for regressions.  \n\nThere are some OEMs like Samsung that [consistently roll out](https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-january-2022-security-patch-international/) security updates *before* public disclosure, which is odd to see given that Google shares the Bulletin and patches with its partners under an embargo that lifts when the Bulletin goes public. By pushing an update before the ASB goes public, hackers can theoretically discover what vulnerabilities have been patched by comparing the previous and current versions of the firmware, but it’s unlikely that this happens given how few days they have to do this before the ASB goes public anyway. Once the ASB goes public [on Google’s website](https://source.android.com/security/bulletin), any user can see the list of security vulnerabilities that have been addressed, though some of the technical details will remain accessible only to Google’s Android partners. \n\n##What’s on the Android Security Bulletin?  \n\nGoogle is the single largest contributor to AOSP, so of course they discover many vulnerabilities themselves. Android is a huge platform, though, so many vulnerabilities are found by independent researchers or third-party companies. Vulnerabilities in AOSP aren’t the only vulnerabilities included in the ASB, though. Google also lists patches for the Linux kernel (which Android’s kernel is forked from) and closed source vendor components. Patches for AOSP and Linux kernel vulnerabilities can be picked from their respective upstream sources, but technical details on and patches for closed source vendor components are available only from the company that makes them.  \n\nOnce vulnerabilities have been disclosed, Google assigns them a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID, categorizes them by [type](https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2021-12-01#type), gives them a [severity assessment](https://source.android.com/security/overview/updates-resources#severity), and lists them alongside their affected Android version(s). In addition, the ASB preview for Android partners lists the specific subcomponent that’s affected, a brief technical description of the vulnerability, and a short description of the fix that’s being applied. Google also shares a link to download the patches in a ZIP file as well as the latest binary of the Security Test Suite (STS), a tool that automatically validates whether certain patches have been integrated properly. The STS [doesn’t guarantee](https://www.xda-developers.com/android-oem-lying-security-patches/) that every patch has been integrated properly, but if a test has been written for a patch, then there’s a good chance that it’ll be picked up.  \n\nGoogle discloses these vulnerabilities to Android partners about a month before the public Android Security Bulletin. The January 2022 ASB, for example, went public on January 4, 2022, but a preview of the ASB was shared with Android partners on December 6, 2021. Most of the vulnerabilities detailed in any given ASB are disclosed to Google in the two months before the Bulletin goes public, but in some cases, the time between initial disclosure and the patch being made available could be even longer. For instance, the (arguably harmless) escalation of privilege bug that I [helped discover in Android 12’s Fabricated Overlay API](https://www.xda-developers.com/android-12s-fabricated-overlay-api-brings-back-rootless-themes/) was disclosed on October 11, 2021, and a patch was authored shortly after on October 18, 2021. However, the patch wasn’t committed to Google’s internal Android 12 branch until November 24, 2021, so CVE-2021-39630 was only addressed in the January 2022 ASB even though it’s been nearly 3 months since it was disclosed. On the other hand, the very serious emergency calling bug that I alluded to earlier was publicly disclosed by a Samsung engineer with [a patch to AOSP](https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/packages/services/Telecomm/+/1903050) on November 25, 2021, which gave enough time for CVE-2021-39659 to be included in the January 2022 ASB.  \n\n[*A screenshot of the public Android Security Bulletin for January 2022*](https://imgur.com/5qFcD8i)\n\nRegardless of when the vulnerability was actually disclosed, OEMs get about a one month head start to integrate and test their builds before public disclosure. Before the public disclosure happens, though, Google may update the ASB preview to remove patches that are incomplete or which require more time to test. This happened twice with the January 2022 ASB, once on December 13 and again on December 28, a week before public disclosure. Details on these patches are kept under embargo until a future ASB, though Android partners are not required to remove any patches they have already integrated.  \n\n(The term “Android partners”, by the way, has a specific meaning here. I’m referring to the [hundreds of companies](https://www.android.com/certified/partners/) that [have shipped or plan to ship](https://www.android.com/gms/contact/) an “Android-compatible” device, which is a device that meets [Android’s compatibility requirements](https://source.android.com/compatibility/overview) and ships with Google Mobile Services.)  \n\n##It’s time to update the security patch level  \n\nOnce it’s time for the public ASB to go live, Android partners can then roll out updates containing these security patches. The time it takes to roll out the update varies, as previously mentioned, because of multiple factors. For one, an OEM may need to make additional changes to integrate the security patch if the patch conflicts with existing code. Second, the OEM or SoC vendor may discover vulnerabilities that only affect their specific fork of Android (many OEMs and SoC vendors publish their own security bulletins for this reason). Third, the OEM may need to integrate additional patches for vulnerabilities disclosed by SoC vendors outside of Google’s ASB. Patches for the [MediaTek-su vulnerability](https://www.xda-developers.com/mediatek-su-rootkit-exploit/), for example, were ready in May of 2019, 10 months before the patch was included in the March 2020 ASB. Fourth, carriers may want to recertify the build to ensure compatibility with their networks. Lastly, OEMs may choose to wait to roll out a security update so they can also release some feature upgrades at the same time (this is a problem I’ll get to in more detail later). Initiatives like [Project Treble](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/05/here-comes-treble-modular-base-for.html), [extended Linux kernel LTS](https://www.xda-developers.com/linux-kernel-long-term-support-google/?), [Project Mainline](https://source.android.com/devices/architecture/modular-system), and the [Generic Kernel Image](https://source.android.com/devices/architecture/kernel/generic-kernel-image), were designed to reduce the technical complexity of merging patches, resulting in speedier security updates.  \n\nWhen the update is ready to be pushed, OEMs update a string in their builds to signal that the software contains the security patches listed in a particular ASB. This string, the system property ro.build.version.security_patch, must be set to the appropriate security patch level (SPL).   \n\nEvery month, there are two SPLs: a partial and complete SPL. The partial SPL ends with -01 in the string, while the complete SPL ends with -05 in the string. For example, the partial SPL for this month is 2022-01-01, while the complete SPL is 2022-01-05. The format of the partial SPL can be generalized as YYYY-MM-01 while the complete SPL can be generalized as YYYY-MM-05.  \n\n[*The Pixel 4's January 2022 update declares the 2022-01-05 complete SPL*](https://imgur.com/a/mVHpTO2)  \n\nBuilds declaring the partial SPL must contain patches to all of the vulnerabilities affecting AOSP, which includes the Android OS framework, the media framework, system components, and Project Mainline modules. Builds declaring the complete SPL must contain patches to all vulnerabilities affecting AOSP as well as the Linux kernel and closed-source vendor components.  \n\nSince the SPL is denoted by a string defined by the OEM, there’s no guarantee that the build actually contains all of the patches that are required for that SPL. Researchers in mid-2018 [discovered](https://www.xda-developers.com/android-oem-lying-security-patches/) a significant “patch gap” between the SPL many phones reported and what vulnerabilities those phones were protected against. Automated tests like the STS help OEMs ensure that most patches are included in their builds, fortunately.   \n\n##What went wrong with the security patch process for the Pixel 6?  \n\nAs I mentioned previously, the January 2022 update for the Pixel 6 series won’t roll out until later this month, leaving most Pixel 6 users on the older November 2021 SPL. The reason behind the delay is related to connectivity issues discovered shortly after the December 2021 update rolled out to some users.   \n\nWhy were there connectivity issues in a build that [was already delayed by a week?](https://www.droid-life.com/2021/12/13/pixel-6s-big-december-update-is-now-available/) Well, it was the winter holiday, so Google was probably short-staffed. Furthermore, the Pixel’s December 2021 update didn’t just include the patches disclosed in the ASB — it also included the changes from [the big Android 12 QPR1 release](https://www.esper.io/blog/android-dessert-bites-4-powered-by-esper) which were marketed as part of the quarterly [Pixel Feature Drop](https://blog.google/products/pixel/snap-faster-hear-better-and-do-more-your-pixel/). Android 12 was Google’s biggest OS update in years, and given the approximately one-year turnaround for its development, it’s no surprise that the initial release had a lot of bugs and unresolved issues.   \n\nThat’s another reason the December 2021 update was particularly noteworthy: [it fixed nearly 100 bugs in Android 12](https://9to5google.com/2021/12/06/pixel-6-december-update/). Fixing so many bugs and integrating the Android 12 QPR1 codebase necessitated extensive testing, but Google doesn’t do public beta tests for quarterly releases, so they had to test everything internally. The approximately 1.5 month long period for testing and certification was clearly insufficient this time around, though. Tying the release of a security update to a big feature update is risky, and this time, it resulted in the security update being significantly delayed.  \n\nMerging the December 2021 patches, Pixel Feature Drop, and Quarterly Platform Release into one update is great for marketing and convenient for users, but these updates don’t need to be combined. Instead of having Pixel 6 users sit on a build that’s vulnerable to a [high severity denial of service exploit that could block emergency calling](https://medium.com/@mmrahman123/how-a-bug-in-android-and-microsoft-teams-could-have-caused-this-users-911-call-to-fail-6525f9ba5e63), Google should release a security update sans QPR1 changes. Alternatively, they could push an update that contains a few patches fixing only the most critical security issues, which is how they [fixed the emergency calling bug on the Pixel 3](https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1478801245942992896) series despite leaving it on the October 2021 SPL. Google knows how severe this issue is, which is why they even [backported security patches to Android 8.0-8.1](https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1478435883355365379) for OEMs to pick even though Google only commits to backporting security patches to Android versions [that are less than 3.5 years old](https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1478095149779537925). Google wants to release new security updates once a month and new quarterly platform releases once every three months, but there’s no reason they can’t step out of that cycle occasionally. Committing to a once-a-month release cycle has its benefits, of course, as it makes updates more predictable and less annoying for users. However, I believe an exception needs to be made when it comes to updates that fix major security issues — patches are immediately made available all the time for critical security issues that affect other software we use on a day-to-day basis.",

Uses remote systems resources to make scanning fast\n3. Does not hash the jar as it could be nested or edited\n4. Identifies the following vulnerabilities CVE-2021-44228, CVE-2021-45046, CVE-2021-45105\n5. Searches all drives on system excluding mapped drives\n6. Creates CSV list of affected files and locations\n7. Creates JSON file with all information including errors like access issues to folders (so you know spots that might have been missed)\n8. Scans JAR, WAR, EAR, JPI, HPI\n9. Checks nested files\n10. Does not unzip files, just loads them into memory and checks them making the scanner fast and accurate\n11. Identifies through pom.properties version number and if JNDI Class is present.\n\n\n[https://github.com/Maelstromage/Log4jSherlock](https://github.com/Maelstromage/Log4jSherlock)\n\n# Comments\nI decided to write this because I have noticed a lot of other scanners did not consider some important points that would let some of these vulnerable files through the cracks. Like:\n1. Scanner for files with Log4j in it instead of the JNDI Class\n2. Only scanning for JAR files\n3. Scanning for hashed jar files which doesn't account for nested files.\n\n# Instructions:\n\n1. Download the ps1 file \n2. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maelstromage/Log4jSherlock/main/Log4Sherlock.ps1\n3. Create the file computers.txt\n4. Fill computers.txt with hostnames\n5.

    "title": "PATCH NOW - Hackers are mass-scanning the Internet in search of VMware servers with a newly disclosed code-execution vulnerability that has a severity rating of 9.8 out of a possible 10. CVE-2021-21974",
    "text": "**A malicious actor with access to a host compromised in your network with access to port 443 may exploit this issue to execute commands with unrestricted privileges on the underlying operating system that hosts vCenter Server.**\n\nCVE-2021-21974, as the security flaw is tracked, is a remote code-execution vulnerability in VMware vCenter server, an application for Windows or Linux that administrators use to enable and manage virtualization of large networks. Within a day of [VMware issuing a patch](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2021-0002.html), proof-of-concept exploits [appeared](https://gist.github.com/milo2012/9ba4ac8bb0dfa59497d02b27d820eeb5) from [at](https://github.com/NS-Sp4ce/CVE-2021-21972) [least](http://noahblog.360.cn/vcenter-6-5-7-0-rce-lou-dong-fen-xi/) [six](https://github.com/QmF0c3UK/CVE-2021-21972-vCenter-6.5-7.0-RCE-POC) [different](https://github.com/horizon3ai/CVE-2021-21972) [sources](https://github.com/yaunsky/CVE-2021-21972). The severity of the vulnerability, combined with the availability of working exploits for both Windows and Linux machines, sent hackers scrambling to actively find vulnerable servers.\n\n“We’ve detected mass scanning activity targeting vulnerable VMware vCenter servers ([https://vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2021-0002.html](https://vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2021-0002.html)),”\n\n## Unfettered code execution, no authorization required\n\nCVE-2021-21972 allows hacker with no authorization to upload files to vulnerable vCenter servers that are publicly accessible over port 443, researchers from security firm Tenable [said](https://www.tenable.com/blog/cve-2021-21972-vmware-vcenter-server-remote-code-execution-vulnerability?utm_source=charge&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=internal-comms). Successful exploits will result in hackers gaining unfettered remote code-execution privileges in the underlying operating system. The vulnerability stems from a lack of authentication in the vRealize Operations plugin, which is installed by default.\n\nThe flaw has received a severity score of 9.8 out of 10.0 on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System Version 3.0. Mikhail Klyuchnikov, the Positive Technologies researcher who discovered the vulnerability and privately reported it to VMware, compared the risk posed by CVE-2021-21972 to that of [CVE-2019-19781](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/01/unpatched-citrix-vulnerability-now-exploited-patch-weeks-away/), a critical vulnerability in the Citrix Application Delivery Controller.\n\nCVE-2021-21972 affects vCenter Server versions 6.5, 6.7, and 7.01. Users running one of these versions should update to 6.5 U3n, 6.7 U3l, or 7.0 U1c as soon as possible. Those who can’t immediately install a patch should implement [these workarounds](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/82374), which involve changing a compatibility matrix file and setting the vRealize plugin to incompatible. Admins who have vCenter servers directly exposed to the Internet should strongly consider curbing the practice or at least using a VPN.\n\n[https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/02/armed-with-exploits-hackers-on-the-prowl-for-a-critical-vmware-vulnerability/](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/02/armed-with-exploits-hackers-on-the-prowl-for-a-critical-vmware-vulnerability/)",

When I took a CCNA class in 2008, I learned more about networking in the first couple weeks than I thought I knew after 9 years as a system admin.\n\nI've said this many times here, but networking is easily the least understood area of IT by the largest number of admins.  Most of who would claim to \"know\" networking if asked, even though they couldn't give an accurate definition of what a subnet mask is or answer very basic routing, switching, and firewall questions.  That was exactly what I was before that class.\n\nMany admins end up building up a whole bunch of nonsense about networking in their heads, usually based on nothing more than, \"I did this once and it worked\", then go off to make critical infrastructure and security decisions based on what they think they know.\n\nMy advice to any admin who thinks they might be who I'm talking about here, \n\n- First learn subnetting using binary.  Once you really understand that, I bet a whole fuckload of \"weird\" networking problems you have encountered in your career, suddenly make perfect sense.  \n\n- From there, learn the OSI model and how to properly troubleshoot using layers.  \n\n- Then learn how routing and switching really works to the point where you can accurately explain encapsulation and the differences between a segment, packet, and a frame.\n\n- Finally move on to firewalls and VPN's, which should be making a whole lot more sense to you by this point. \n\nBy that point, you will be able to very quickly confirm or eliminate the network as the problem 90% of the time in small to medium sized environments, and you will be amazed at how easy it is and how much of it just makes sense once you know how to really works.",

Sometimes lack of interest in setting up VPNs is genuine ignorance of setting one up although most FW vendors have enough online documentation that you should be able to set it up even if you forgot some of the steps.  Many SMB admins though just have a pretty underwhelming concept of InfoSec.  For companies much smaller than 100 often rarely have security audits unless they're in a heavily regulated industry.  Heck, in some small businesses I have seen managers that are openly hostile towards even basic security measures.  It isn't uncommon for some egotistical SMB managers to keep written password lists of all their users and not let users change their password.  In larger companies those type of managers can find that the CISO is telling HR to walk them out the front door (there was a thread here about one middle manager where that happened), but at some small companies some managers even trying to explain why it is a bad idea goes nowhere.  Same with setting up a VPN client.  You'll find some managers that whine that they have to do one more step to RDP into a box.  Even if you have LDAP integration where it is the same creds they will complain how \"complicated\" that is.  Some admins just give up trying to explain things.",

If you are just checking credentials and don't need to know the password itself, then a hash algorithm should have been used as those are supposed to be one way. If you are storing credentials to access another resource, then that becomes a hell of a lot more complicated because there is a lot more to protect and lock down. In Windows you do have secure password storage, but believe it can be machine independent but defaults in tying the store to user/machine an not portable. Reversible encryption means you have keys to protect or making sure that the user context being used is protected as best as you can. Teamviewer is multiplatform so I would guess that a design decision was made to handle credential information this way to be platform independent and a decision was made to store the key in the registry with little to no protection.\n\nThe issue is rarely the tool but how you are using the tool. Features pay for software not security which tends to makes security an afterthought. \"Proper\" security usually means balancing productivity vs. security which is not a technical issue but a jellyware decision (i.e. execs deciding what the pain threshold is).",

    "text": "Why YSK: I, like many others, pretty much avoid updating Windows unless absolutely positively necessary. This is definitely an absolutely positively necessary case.\n\nThe details of the exploit are on this [Windows bulletin](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2024-30078). It doesn't require anyone to have physical access to your PC, and it doesn't require you to have downloaded anything off a suspicious website. Anyone who doesn't have the update is vulnerable if someone is simply within wi-fi range of your device.\n\nA security patched was released ASAP by Windows, but if you don't update Windows regularly or automatically, then you might not have downloaded it. Especially if you're using a Windows laptop it's imperative you get this update, remote code execution is one of the worst forms of exploit.\n\nAs you can see in the update, *all* currently supported versions of Windows are affected, from Windows 11 all the way to Windows Server 2008; likely this affects *all* versions of Windows with wi-fi, including 7 and Vista and XP and other out of support versions. They will not be getting the update and will be vulnerable forever.\n\nTo perform the update, just search `update` in the Windows search bar and `Check for Updates` should appear. *Even if* it says that the system is up to date and the last check was very recent, initiate a manual check and you will likely see something like `2024-06 Cumulative update for Windows` appear.\n\nMost of the information I got from [this 4 minute youtube video from Eric Parker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lhat4g3mVw), if you want more details I recommend watching it.",

    "text": "Hey fellow sysadmins.\n\nSo, a while back I posted this, some might remember:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/jaese9/witnessed\\_my\\_first\\_esxi\\_ransomware\\_crypts\\_vms\\_at/](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/jaese9/witnessed_my_first_esxi_ransomware_crypts_vms_at/)\n\nWe weren't the only ones hit with it. It did also hit Brazil's Superior Justice Tribunal (hereon called STJ), and crypted 1000 VMs there. The attack was run by the same gang; as the ransom note had the exact same wording.\n\nJust to refresh the minds, the ransomware did crypt the VMs at datastore level, and the ransom note was left at the root of the datastores.\n\nWe and them use FC storage, which doesn't allow a host to directly read the contents of the datastore outside the ESXi servers, as all storage areas are only mapped to the ESXi hosts. No LAN-free backups here.\n\nThis attack was also ran against other government institutions, some did succeed, others not. The worst of all was against the STJ, which cripped their systems and left them weeks without any servers up at all. Even the disk backups were torched.\n\nWell, the attack kinda went this way:\n\n1. Three users inside the company clicked and installed a trojan that was sent thru e-mail (we use 365, no ATP).\n2. The attackers escalated privileges using CVE-2020-1472 ([https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2020-1472](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2020-1472)). Workstations had Kaspersky AV, which at the time didn't have the signature for this trojan, it came a few days late;\n3. Attackers gained access to hosts that had access to ESXi's management subnet, as they already got AD admin privileges;\n4. Without having to compromise vCenter, they were able to run arbitraty code on the ESXi hosts using   CVE-2019-5544 ([https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2019-0022.html](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2019-0022.html)) or CVE-2020-3992 ([https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2020-0023.html](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2020-0023.html)) .\n5. This led to the creation of a python executable file on ESXi hosts which led to the VMs getting encrypted. Here's a URL explaining how it works: [https://securelist.com/ransomexx-trojan-attacks-linux-systems/99279/](https://securelist.com/ransomexx-trojan-attacks-linux-systems/99279/);\n\nHere are the MD5 signatures of the files all y'all need to be aware. The svc-new/svc-new is the name of the python script that was inside the ESXi hosts. The notepad.exe was found on the crypted Windows servers which survived:\n\nMD5 (svc-new/svc-new) = 4bb2f87100fca40bfbb102e48ef43e65MD5 (notepad.exe) = 80cfb7904e934182d512daa4fe0abbfbSHA1 (svc-new/svc-new) = 3bf79cc3ed82edd6bfe1950b7612a20853e28b0SHA1 (notepad.exe) = 9df15f471083698b818575c381e49c914dee69de\n\nBoth us and them were saved by good 'ol tape backups which were not compromised. Recovery, however, was a nightmare, and each VM had to be screened on SIEM to make sure they weren't talking back to the bad guys anymore.\n\nThe recommendations that were made were:\n\n* \\- Disable the VMware CIM Server (it's on by default)\n* \\- Apply least privileges on your Active Directory administration.\n* \\- Segregate Admin and Domain admin accounts on AD.\n* \\- Have a GPO to log out users on inactivity instead of disconnecting them on Remote Desktop Servers.\n* \\- Audit actions on Domain Admin accounts\n* \\- Review the backup routines and make sure they aren't reachable by an attacker;\n* \\- Maintain offsite read-only backups to make sure recovery is possible;\n* \\- Constitute an isolated network for ESXi/vCenter, which needs to have its access audited, using a jump server;\n* \\- Maintain access controls by IP to vCenter and ESXi;\n* \\- Remove vCenter Active Directory integration and maintain distinct passwords;\n* \\- Maintain SSH disabled on all ESXi hosts (though that wouldn't have saved us);\n* \\- Implement the usage of canary files monitored by a SIEM;\n* \\- Maintain internal campaigns to educate about phishing;\n* \\- Use 2FA whereever it is possible, especially on admin accounts;\n* Patch Windows Servers, workstations, ESXi servers, backup servers, vCenter as frequently as possible and in more automated way possible, reviewing reporting on failed patch installation to assure all gear is up to date.\n\nAnd to wrap this up, the Brazilian Data Processing Service (Serpro) is maintaining a list of IPs which tried to attack any Federal Government system, and is available for use by everyone:\n\n[http://reputation.serpro.gov.br](http://reputation.serpro.gov.br)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT1: Added patching to the recommendations.

It isn't because we're slower to apply updates, and it's not because of systematic manual testing in separate test environments.\n\nOne thing I gave up on years ago was trying to get end-users to explicitly test anything they didn't have to, *unless* perhaps they can test it as a side-effect while still \"getting their work done\" with no extra risk. We previously spent a lot of time and effort trying to de-risk by having stakeholders test, yet they never would, and even when they did it was perfunctory.\n\nSo we redirected those resources to two things: automating all integration testing, and (to a limited extent) fully-functional \"beta\" environments. The beta environments were functional with production resources, and not just isolated sandboxes. Because it was isolated sandbox environments that we could never, ever induce stakeholders to test on.\n\nSo, for example, there might be a `vpn.foo.example.org` production VPN service, and a `vpn-beta.foo.example.org` independent beta service that also accesses the same production nets. If it was an isolated test environment that couldn't access anything, no stakeholder would ever spend a moment with it. But if it's a functional beta, you can get stakeholders to validate it, especially if there are newer features or better performance.\n\nEventually this can evolve into a sort of A/B testing with infrastructure, or \"canary deployments\". If telemetry indicates that users stay connected to `vpn-beta` for dramatically shorter time than the production service, there's probably something wrong with it.",

Alternatively patches have to be approved by the vendor before deployment (and they are often months behind on testing definitions)\n\nBad Experiences - IT staff deal with the consequences of 1 bad patch and from then on they are shy to deploy updates because they don't want to clean up the mess. Doesn't matter what the patch was for, IT get blamed for the downtime it caused.\n\nLack of Testing equipment - IT doesn't have budget or resources to have a dedicated DR or testing facilities to try out a series of patches before deployment, so every patch cycle is a potential gamble. One of the common phrases I hear is \"Never deploy patches on Day 1, let the fortune 500s test it for you\"\n\nUptime - Companies refuse to accept any downtime during certain periods due to the pressure to meet production quotas, month end, quarterly earnings, whatever.\n\nCompany doesn't take IT security seriously enough - I don't really need to expand on this further.\n\nOverworked and under paid IT staff - Not enough staff to perform scheduled maintenance. When staff spend there days fighting fires, performing scheduled maintenance becomes an after thought.

The only thing that works is automated testing.\n\n---\n\nBack in the day, every deployment of one app-stack of ours used to have a junior QA team member on hand to dutifully run a smoke test after deployment. Little details that weren't up front in the web-page tended to get missed, like email notifications, monitoring, instrumentation. That app usually had one scheduled deployment per quarter, and about half the time had another bugfix deployment two weeks later. With an average of six deploys per year, it was a routine operation, yet not routine enough that human error didn't creep in frequently.\n\nChanging that to automated integration tests fixed a huge number of issues all at once. Once a given aspect was under test, there were no human mistakes about it. Without needing a QA staffer on hand, deployments became less formal and more lightweight. Deployments no longer took hours, during daylight on weekends. Since deployments were faster, much more consistent with few regressions, and less disruptive, deployments happened more often. A virtuous spiral was the result.\n\n---\n\nWhat we try to use today are integration tests that run *continously* against infrastructure. I realized that the integration tests run after a deployment could just as easily be run from a monitoring system, as long as they were lightweight enough.\n\nSo instead of a ping test, an SNMP probe, or an HTTP request against a static healthcheck endpoint, our monitoring checks the service. The HTTP(S) endpoint is one that runs a lightweight SQL query and checks all the microservices. Now the monitoring and load-balancers themselves are confirming the health of the whole stack, not just pinging one host in isolation.\n\nAnd so we have monitoring that checks Authentication, Authorization, filesystem exports and their ACLs, time-sync, service discovery, DNS zone consistency across authoritatives. It even does a limited amount of security checking as one aid to ensure against regressions. For example, if SMB1 has been banned from the organization, and you're going to check SMB exports anyway, you might as well confirm that none of the checked SMB exports support SMB version 1. (There are also separate dedicated continuous security scanners [like this example from UCB](https://security.berkeley.edu/services/campus-wide-network-vulnerability-scanning/details-vulnerability-scanning-programs).)\n\n---\n\nThen when you have monitoring systems preventing regressions, at some point you start writing the tests before you remediate. It collects metrics for you, to push to stakeholders who want to know [what it is you do around here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_D3d1RWBrI). In bigger and federated organizations, you can set things up so that certain services are grandfathered to be able to run obsolete ciphers, but any new endpoint added to monitoring has to be compliant with the latest standards, or else there are big orange warnings in the dashboard.

There's a new version of Windows, but the upgrade path is expected to last beyond the support lifetime of the previous version.\n\n(Or of Ubuntu, or CentOS, or RHEL.  I've seen each and every one of those.)\n\nBecause change is scary, people broke stuff at some point, and more processes and procedures have been put in place to make sure that said breaks don't happen again...\n\nUntil it's simply easier to fail to apply security updates for several months than it is to try and have your organization up to date every month.\n\nAnd _automated_ updates are definitely Right Out, because they have a history of breaking things. (Thank you Microsoft for making that problem far worse.)\n\nAnd yet, the alternative is a never ending, utterly predictable, pattern of major security vulnerabilities that are never patched, which get exploited.  It's ransom ware attacks that cripple the company.  It's the very attacks you mentioned, and many more besides.\n\nIt really, badly, needs to change.  But quite simply we are still at the point where in _many_ companies, the IT department simply does not have the authority to fix the problem.  It's not that they don't _want_ to, it's that the company as a whole doesn't understand the issue, doesn't want to understand the issue, and certainly doesn't want to listen to people complaining about the issue.",

This is especially likely in situations where change requires work, coordination, communication, and lack of change requires none of that effort.\n\nWorst of all, change freezes often *work*, at first, as far as the stakeholders are concerned. Then, with each passing day, the prospect of going through with that accumulated backlog of change gets less and less attractive. Then before you know it, four years have passed and there's a small mountain of accumulated bitrot.\n\n---\n\nMy prescription is to start by making patching, or small changes, *less* work than the alternative. Less work for the stakeholders, at least. Have a standing downtime window or \"at-risk window\" where it's assumed that maintenance is likely to take place. Then if anyone needs it canceled, they can fill out some change-control paperwork and wait for the response from the committee.\n\nWe still have Dev, QA, canary patch rollouts. But we make sure that no special permission or particular action is required. Continuous patching, or continuous updates, or continuous small nondisruptive deployments, are assumed. The only non-routine thing is to halt the normal pace of change.\n\n---\n\nThen while establishing the new assumption of nondisruptive, continous change, work on making it truly *nondisruptive*. As I wrote in other parts of the thread, we mainly use batteries of automated tests. Many of these tests are linked into the monitoring system, so they run very frequently. Dev and QA are also monitored, so be sure to resource monitoring systems to watch those.\n\nSomething I didn't mention is dogfooding. We usually don't know how the apps work and have to rely on tests, but when it comes to infrastructure, engineers should be using it first. This is when it's helpful to have a few engineers using Arch Linux, because you can usually count on Arch to break things first...\n\nWhich reminds me -- I seem to have a case where Clang/LLVM 9.0.1 generates bad assembly, bizarrely enough, that I've been procrastinating on tracking down because I don't know AMD64 assembly. The procrastination was useful, though, because it reminded me to check the IR before pulling out a reference book.",

    "title": "PSA: New ransomware campaign (Petya/GoldenEye) being conducted that will render your computer unbootable if infected. Relies on WannaCry exploit (MS17-010). Make sure your machines are patched and updated to avoid infection.",
    "text": "*Ever get that feeling of déjà vu?*\n\n---\n\n**Note:** When I refer to **Petya** in this post, I'm referring to the malware strain that's currently spreading around the world. This also goes by the name of **GoldenEye**, **NotPetya**, and **Petwrap**. According to Kapersky, this virus is unrelated to the earlier strains of Petya (hence NotPetya), but both because a lot of this remains applicable regardless and because I'm lazy I'm not going to change this.\n\n# What's happening?\n\nRansomware is a type of malware that encrypts all of your files and tells you to pay a certain amount of money to get the decryption key. This type of malware has been steadily becoming more and more popular over the past few years, especially because the payout for a successful campaign can be quite lucrative. A very high profile ransomware attack occurred last month in the form of WannaCry, which infected hundreds of thousands of computers and interrupted work globally. This strain of ransomware was notable because it had the ability to spread to other computers over a network, which allowed it to spread much more effectively than otherwise.\n\nPetya is a particular family of malware that has been notable for its ruthlessness. While most ransomware strains simply infect your files, leaving the computer otherwise usable, Petya overwrites your computer's boot sector^([1]) and makes it point to a special operating system that performs the file encryption. \n\nThe current Petya campaign, centered in the Ukraine but not confined there, is basically an unholy hybrid of Petya and WannaCry. [It spreads to computers using an infected Office document,](https://imgur.com/a/fFGVL) and once it's on there it attempts to spread itself to other computers using both MS17-010 (the WannaCry exploit developed by the NSA) and system tools like PsExec and WMI^([2]) that allow users to run commands on remote systems. How does it do that? It checks to see if there are any administrator credentials cached on your machine and uses them to authenticate on other computers if there are. It's a clever approach: infect the unpatched machines, then get the passwords and use them to infect the patched machines. \n\ntl;dr [it's bad. it's really, really bad](https://twitter.com/TedOnPrivacy/status/879721978051141632)\n\n# How are people getting infected?\n\nI will be updating this section as I learn more.\n\nRight now, it appears that Petya utilizes ~~two~~ one patched bug~~s~~, ~~[CVE-2017-0199](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/04/cve-2017-0199-hta-handler.html) and~~ [MS17-010](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/ms17-010.aspx), to spread itself. Make sure your machines are patched against these.\n\n**Initially, Petya gets onto a computer through an infected Microsoft Office or Wordpad document**. This can be sent to you through a variety of methods, though I suspect in most cases it will be via a malicious email (a very common attack vector). If the file is opened, it will download a copy of the virus onto your computer and run it. **Once a machine is infected, it will use [a known SMB v1 bug](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/ms17-010.aspx) to infect other computers.** This exploit, codenamed MS17-010, [is the same exploit that was used in the WannaCry campaign conducted last month](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/6atu62/psa_massive_ransomware_campaign_wcry_is_currently/). If it can reach a vulnerable computer, it will use a bug in the SMB v1 implementation to infect the remote machine. It can do this without permission, which you might be able to tell is a huge issue. \n\nWhile I don’t have the full details involving this yet, **Petya also appears to look for cached network credentials to infect machines via WMI**^([2]). This means that even if you are fully patched against MS17-010, you still run the risk of getting infected. Reduce your attack surface as much as possible.\n\n**EDIT** - [Looks like a vaccine for the WMI/PsExec attack vector has been found.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/vaccine-not-killswitch-found-for-petya-notpetya-ransomware-outbreak/) \n\n# What can I do?\n\nIf you've been infected, I'm sorry, but as of now there's no known file recovery method. You will have to either restore from backup (you do have backups, right?) or reformat your PC.\n\nIf your computer has crashed with a blue screen, ***under no circumstances should you allow Windows to reboot.*** Petya begins encrypting your files after it restarts, which renders them impossible to recover (as of this writing). Instead, use a Linux live CD or USB and back up your personal data, or clone the hard drive for later data recovery. \n\n**If you have not yet been infected, patch your machines.** It won't eliminate the possibility of getting infected, but it'll reduce the attack surface that the virus can exploit.\n\nHere are the patches you need to install, if you haven’t already:\n\n### MS17-010\n\n| Product | Latest security update rollup (install this if you don't know what to install) | Standalone update | \n| --- | --- | --- | \n| Windows 10 / Server 2016 **v1703** | You're already safe, [but you might as well update to be safe](http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=KB4022725) | N/A |\n| Windows 10 / Server 2016 **v1607**| [KB4022715](http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=KB4022715) (OS Build 14393.1358) | N/A | \n| Windows 10 / Server 2016 **v1511** | [KB4022714](http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=KB4022714) | N/A |\n| Windows 10 / Server 2016 **Initial Release** | [KB4022727](http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=KB4022727) | N/A |\n| Windows 8.1 / Server 2012 R2 | [KB4022717](http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=KB4022717) | [KB4012213](http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=KB4012213)\n| Windows Server 2012 | [KB4022718](http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=KB4022718) | [KB4012214](http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=KB4012214)\n| Windows 8 ^([3]) | N/A | [KB4012598](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/msrc/2017/05/12/customer-guidance-for-wannacrypt-attacks/)\n| Windows 7 / Server 2008 R2 | [KB4022722](http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=KB4022722) | [KB4012212](http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=KB4012212) |\n| Windows Vista / Server 2008 | N/A | [KB4012598](http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=KB4012598)\n| Windows XP / Server 2003 ^([3]) | N/A | [KB4012598](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/msrc/2017/05/12/customer-guidance-for-wannacrypt-attacks/) | \n\n### WMI/PsExec \n\nIt appears that the encryption routine for this won't run if a certain file (`C:\\Windows\\perfc`) exists and is marked as read only.

Seriously, the fact that someone is still letting these people make IT decisions and hold some position of authority astounds me. To say that you are disabling windows update because of a problem that you had, to me, suggests that you are stringing along old ass equipment that should replaced or you lack the proper problem solving and/or critical thinking skills that are required to do your job. Eventually, someone will come along and reveal these people for the fools that they are and they will be asked to leave. As they are walked out on that final grave day with their little box of personal items and chachkies, the will do so without their pride or dignity.

    "text": " \n\n## Microsoft Windows CryptoAPI fails to properly validate ECC certificate chains\n\n### Overview\n\nThe Microsoft Windows CryptoAPI fails to properly validate certificates that use Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), which may allow an attacker to spoof the validity of certificate chains.\n\n### Description\n\nThe Microsoft Windows [CryptoAPI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/seccrypto/cryptoapi-system-architecture), which is provided by Crypt32.dll, fails to validate ECC certificates in a way that properly leverages the protections that ECC cryptography should provide. As a result, an attacker may be able to craft a certificate that appears to have the ability to be traced to a trusted root certificate authority.\n\nAny software, including third-party non-Microsoft software, that relies on the Windows [CertGetCertificateChain()](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/wincrypt/nf-wincrypt-certgetcertificatechain) function to determine if an X.509 certificate can be traced to a trusted root CA may incorrectly determine the trustworthiness of a [certificate chain](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/seccrypto/certificate-chains).\n\n### Impact\n\nBy exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker may be able to spoof a valid X.509 certificate chain on a vulnerable Windows system. This may allow various actions including, but not limited to, interception and modification of TLS-encrypted communications or spoofing an [Authenticode](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/authenticode) signature.\n\n### Solution\n\n**Apply an update**  \n\n\nThis vulnerability is addressed in the [Microsoft Update for CVE-2020-0601](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-0601)\n\nTaken from - [https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/849224/](https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/849224/)",

    "title": "Hacker group uses Solaris zero-day to breach corporate networks. The zero-day appears to have been bought off a black-market website for $3,000.",
    "text": "\nMandiant, the investigations unit of security firm FireEye, has published details today about a new threat actor it calls UNC1945 that the security firm says it used a zero-day vulnerability in the Oracle Solaris operating system as part of its intrusions into corporate networks.\n\nRegular targets of UNC1945 attacks included the likes of telecommunications, financial, and consulting companies, the Mandiant team said in a report published today.\n\nOld group, new zero-day \n\nWhile UNC1945 activity went as far back as 2018, Mandiant said the group caught their eye earlier this year after the threat actor utilized a never-before-seen vulnerability in the Oracle Solaris operating system.\n\nTracked as CVE-2020-14871, the zero-day was a vulnerability in the Solaris Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) that allowed UNC1945 to bypass authentication procedures and install a backdoor named SLAPSTICK on internet-exposed Solaris servers.\n\nMandiant said the hackers then used this backdoor as an entry point to launch reconnaissance operations inside corporate networks and move laterally to other systems.\n\nTo avoid detection, Mandiant said the group downloaded and installed a QEMU virtual machine running a version of the Tiny Core Linux OS.\n\nThis custom-made Linux VM came pre-installed with several hacking tools like network scanners, password dumpers, exploits, and reconnaissance toolkits that allowed UNC1945 to scan a company's internal network for weaknesses and move laterally to multiple systems, regardless if they ran Windows or *NIX-based systems.\n\nunc1945.png\nImage: FireEye\nMandiant said it observed the group using an assortment of open-source penetration testing and security tools, but also custom malware strains.\n\nThe open-source toolkits included the likes of Mimikatz, Powersploit, Responder, Procdump, CrackMapExec, PoshC2, Medusa, and the JBoss Vulnerability Scanner, all well-known in the cyber-security industry.\n\nBut UNC1945 also showed the ability to create and operate custom malware, with Mandiant linking UNC1945 intrusions to (new and old) malware strains like:\n\nEVILSUN - a remote exploitation tool that gains access to Solaris 10 and 11 systems of SPARC or i386 architecture using a vulnerability (CVE-2020-14871) exposed by SSH keyboard-interactive authentication. The remote exploitation tool makes SSH connections to hosts passed on the command line. The default port is the normal SSH port (22), but this may be overridden. EVILSUN passes the banner string SSH-2.0-Sun_SSH_1.1.3 over the connection in clear text as part of handshaking.\nLEMONSTICK - a Linux executable command line utility with backdoor capabilities. The backdoor can execute files, transfer files, and tunnel connections. LEMONSTICK can be started in two different ways: passing the `-c` command line argument (with an optional file) and setting the 'OCB' environment variable. When started with the `-c` command line argument, LEMONSTICK spawns an interactive shell. When started in OCB mode, LEMONSTICK expects to read from STDIN. The STDIN data is expected to be encrypted with the blowfish algorithm. After decrypting, it dispatches commands based on the name—for example: 'executes terminal command', 'connect to remote system', 'send & retrieve file', 'create socket connection'.\nLOGBLEACH - an ELF utility that has a primary functionality of deleting log entries from a specified log file(s) based on a filter provided via command line. \nOKSOLO - a publicly available backdoor that binds a shell to a specified port. It can be compiled to support password authentication or dropped into a root shell.\nOPENSHACKLE - a reconnaissance tool that collects information about logged-on users and saves it to a file. OPENSHACKLE registers Windows Event Manager callback to achieve persistence.\nProxyChains - allows the use of SSH, TELNET, VNC, FTP and any other internet application from behind HTTP (HTTPS) and SOCKS (4/5) proxy servers. This \"proxifier\" provides proxy server support to any application.\nPUPYRAT (aka Pupy) - an open source, multi-platform (Windows, Linux, OSX, Android), multi-function RAT (Remote Administration Tool) and post-exploitation tool mainly written in Python. It features an all-in-memory execution guideline and leaves very low footprint. It can communicate using various transports, migrate into processes (reflective injection), and load remote Python code, Python packages and Python C-extensions from memory.\nSTEELCORGI - a packer for Linux ELF programs that uses key material from the executing environment to decrypt the payload. When first starting up, the malware expects to find up to four environment variables that contain numeric values. The malware uses the environment variable values as a key to decrypt additional data to be executed.\nSLAPSTICK - a Solaris PAM backdoor that grants a user access to the system with a secret, hard-coded password.\nTINYSHELL - a lightweight client/server clone of the standard remote shell tools (rlogin, telnet, ssh, etc.), which can act as a backdoor and provide remote shell execution as well as file transfers.\nZero-day bought off the black market?\n\nMandiant said it believes that UNC1945 bought EVILSUN (the tool that allowed them to exploit the Solaris zero-day and plant the SLAPSTICK backdoor) from a public hacking forum.\n\nThe company said it identified an ad in April 2020 on a black-market website that promoted an \"Oracle Solaris SSHD Remote Root Exploit\" for $3,000.\n\nMandiant said it reported the Solaris zero-day to Oracle earlier this year, after discovering traces of exploitation during an investigation.\n\nThe zero-day (CVE-2020-14871) was patched last month in Oracle's October 2020 security patches.\n\nMandiant said that while UNC1945 has been active for several years, it spotted the Solaris zero-day in one confirmed breach; however, this doesn't mean the zero-day wasn't exploited against other corporate networks.\n\nThe security firm said it \"did not observe evidence of data exfiltration and was unable to determine UNC1945's mission for most of the intrusions [they] investigated.\"\n\nIn one UNC1945 intrusion, ransomware was deployed as a final payload, but Mandiant couldn't link the ransomware attack to UNC1945 directly, and \"is likely that access to the victim environment was sold to another group.\"\n\nIndicators of compromise and other technical details describing UNC1945 operations and intrusion patterns are available for defenders in the Mandiant report here.\n\nhttps://www.zdnet.com/article/hacker-group-uses-solaris-zero-day-to-breach-corporate-networks/",

    "title": "PSA: Critical Windows bug (CVE-2017-8620) patched recently. If exploited, attackers can gain full access to your machine. Affects all versions of Windows from 7 onwards. Make sure your machines are patched and updated to avoid future infection.",
    "text": "TL;DR Microsoft just patched a major security vulnerability in Windows that could allow an attacker to take full control of your computer remotely. Patch your computers before shit hits the fan.\n\n[Also, the latest Daily Simple Questions thread can be found here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/search?q=Simple+Questions+Thread+subreddit%3Apcmasterrace+author%3AAutoModerator&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n---\n\n# What's happening?\n\nAs many of you are probably aware, Windows is a very complex operating system with a lot of moving parts. One of those parts is the Windows Search Service (`WSearch`), which is responsible for, you guessed it, searching for files or content in files. Up until yesterday, [there was a bug (CVE-2017-8620) in how it handled performing searches when the objects it was searching had already been loaded into memory](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2017-8620); a special search query could give an attacker full access to your computer, letting them install software or add new users without your permission. This attack can also be performed remotely by performing a search on a SMB share, which can potentially enable a repeat of [WannaCry](/r/pcmasterrace/comments/6atu62/psa_massive_ransomware_campaign_wcry_is_currently/) and [Petya](/r/pcmasterrace/comments/6ju1mp/psa_new_ransomware_campaign_petyagoldeneye_being/).\n\n# What can I do?\n\nNormally, I write up these PSAs while shit is in the process of actually hitting the fan, so it's a welcome change of pace to be pre-emptive for once. \n\nAs of right now, there are two primary ways to address this issue. The first is by actually addressing the root of the problem and patching Windows Search, and the second is to apply a band-aid and disable Windows Search entirely.\n\n### Patching the bug\n\nTo fix this issue, install the requisite patches for your operating system. They are as follows:\n\n| Product | Latest security update rollup (install this if you don't know what to install) | Standalone update | \n| --- | --- | --- | \n| Windows 10 **v1703** | [KB4034674](http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=KB4034674) (if you're unsure, get the cumulative update) | N/A |\n| Windows 10 / Server 2016 **v1607**| [KB4034658](http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=KB4034658) | N/A | \n| Windows 10 / Server 2016 **v1511** | [KB4034660](http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=KB4034660) | N/A |\n| Windows 10 / Server 2016 **Initial Release** | [KB4034668](http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=KB4034668) | N/A |\n| Windows 8.1 / Server 2012 R2 | [KB4034681](http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=KB4034681) | [KB4034672](http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=KB4034672)\n| Windows Server 2012 | [KB4034665](http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=KB4034665) | [KB4034666](http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=KB4034666)\n| Windows 7 / Server 2008 R2 | [KB4034664](http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=KB4034664) | [KB4034679](http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=KB4034679) |\n\n**NOTE** - There are no patches available for Windows Vista, Windows 8, or Windows Server 2008 this time around, as all of these operating systems have reached end-of-life status and no longer receive security updates. Please upgrade to a newer, supported version of Windows if possible.\n\nIf you download the correct patch and Windows says it's not applicable to your system, that means you already have the update installed. If you're not on Windows 10, this could also mean you're trying to install the standalone update when either the monthly quality rollup or the monthly security rollup (the rollups in the table above) has already been installed. \n\n### Disabling Windows Search\n\nIf for whatever reason you can't install updates on your machines, you can disable Windows Search by making a registry edit and running a command. To do this, perform the following steps:\n\n1. Open up the Registry Editor as an administrator. You can do this by either pressing `Win-R` and typing in `regedit`, or you could type `regedit` into the soon-to-be-disabled search box and run it from there.\n2. Navigate to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\WSearch` in the sidebar. \n3. There should be a value in the main pane titled `Start`, with a value of 2 (at least on Windows 10; this might differ between operating systems). Double click this value and change the value to **4**. \n4. Close the Registry Editor and open up an administrator Command Prompt or PowerShell window. For Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 users, you can right click on the Start Button to launch the program as Administrator directly. Windows 7 users should go to the Start Menu, go to Accessories, and right click Command Prompt and Run as Administrator.\n5. Run the following command: \n\n       sc stop WSearch\n\nWindows Search Service will no longer work. While this will protect you from this bug, it very well could inadvertently break applications that rely on it, so weigh your options here. \n\n---\n\nDealing with both WannaCry and Petya was a pain in the ass, especially since at my workplace we had to worry about the threat of infection in addition to getting the machines pached. While patching this will still be something of a challenge, let's hope that this work will pay dividends further in the future. \n\nStay safe, everyone  \n~ Apple",

If you're running ESXi, Workstation, or Fusion, you need to patch ASAP.\n\nOn March 4, 2025, Broadcom pushed emergency fixes for:\n\n* CVE-2025-22224 (Critical, CVSS 9.3) – Lets an attacker escape a VM and execute code on the host.\n* CVE-2025-22225 (High, CVSS 8.2) – Another sandbox escape, meaning if someone gets access to a VM, they could move beyond it.\n* CVE-2025-22226 (Medium, CVSS 7.1) – Info leak vulnerability that could expose sensitive memory data.\n\nThese are already being used in real attacks. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has added all three vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, requiring federal civilian agencies to patch them by March 25, 2025. If you're running ESXi (6.7, 7.0, 8.0), Workstation (17.x), or Fusion (13.x), update now.\n\nIf you can't patch right away, lock down access to VMware services and check your logs for any unusual activity.\n\nSource: [The Hacker News](https://thehackernews.com/2025/03/vmware-security-flaws-exploited-in.html)\n\nTL;DR: Three VMware zero-days are being actively exploited, and CISA is forcing agencies to patch by March 25. If you use VMware, update now or risk getting hit.",

    "title": "Zero-Day Windows Vulnerability Enables Threat Actors To Gain Admin Rights: What We Know So Far",
    "text": "## What Happened?\n\nSecurity researcher Abdelhamid Naceri discovered a privilege escalation vulnerability in Microsoft Windows that can give admin rights to threat actors.\n\nThe vulnerability was discovered when Microsoft released a patch for CVE-2021-41379 (Windows Installer Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability) as a part of the November 2021 Patch Tuesday. Naceri found a bypass to the patch, as well as a more severe zero-day privilege escalation vulnerability, and [published a proof-of-concept exploit ](https://github.com/klinix5/InstallerFileTakeOver)for the zero-day on GitHub.\n\nThis zero-day vulnerability affects all supported client and server versions of Windows, including Windows 10, Windows 11 and Windows Server — even with the latest patches.\n\n## How Bad is This?\n\nPretty bad; privilege elevation is a serious situation, especially when threat actors could elevate from user to admin rights. Throughout 2021 we have seen a growing number of privilege escalation vulnerabilities land on Windows, which is only increasing the attack surface in environments at this point.\n\nThere are no workarounds currently available, according to Naceri. Due to the fact that this vulnerability and exploit leverage existing MSI functionality, it is difficult to inherently workaround.\n\nThe good news is that a threat actor would need local access to the machine to take advantage of this vulnerability. More good news is that Windows Defender detects the PoC.\n\n## What Should I Do?\n\nOrganizations that haven’t already [enabled Sysmon](https://www.blumira.com/enable-sysmon/) in their environment should do so. Blumira’s newly-created PowerShell script, [Poshim](https://www.blumira.com/integration/poshim-automate-windows-log-collection/), streamlines Windows log collection by automatically installing and configuring NXLog and Sysmon to ship logs over Sysmon to a targeted IP.\n\nAlthough there are no workarounds, admins can use an endpoint solution and a security incident and event management (SIEM) platform to detect for signs of the PoC exploit in an environment.\n\n## How To Detect\n\nThis PoC code is easily detectable in its current form due to a built-in MSI (or installer package) and the fact that the PoC has a number of hard-coded naming conventions.\n\nBlumira security experts tested the exploit in their lab environment and found a few ways to detect the PoC:\n\n**Sysmon**\n\nWith Sysmon enabled, admins can look for the following behaviors:\n\n    windows_event_id = 11\n     AND target LIKE '%microsoft plz%'\n\nBy default the PoC [utilizes a target with “microsoft plz”](https://github.com/klinix5/InstallerFileTakeOver/blob/0998671bca5d9c8b64093bc220aa7a8554d22eb5/InstallerFileTakeOver/InstallerFileTakeOver.cpp#L150) in the path, this allows for quick detection opportunities for lazy attackers.\n\nAND\n\n    process_name = 'C:\\\\Windows\\\\system32\\\\msiexec.exe'\n    AND target LIKE '%AppData%splwow64.exe'\n    AND windows_event_id in (11,26)\n\nThe second Sysmon detection uses splwow64.exe in its own AppData folder, which it creates and deletes during the process.\n\n**Windows logs**\n\nAdmins can look for the following Windows logs in Event Log Viewer:\n\n    windows_log_name='Application'\n    AND message LIKE '%test pkg%'\n\nApplication logs that contain hardcoded test pkg similar to “microsoft plz” above. Attackers building their own exploits will not utilize this naming convention however.\n\nAND\n\n    REGEXP_CONTAINS(message, r'Users.*AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\2\\\\\\{[a-fA-F0-9]{8}-[a-fA-F0-9]{4}-[a-fA-F0-9]{4}-[a-fA-F0-9]{4}-[a-fA-F0-9]{12}\\}.msi')\n    AND user='SYSTEM\n    AND user_id='S-1-5-18'\n    AND windows_event_id=1042\n\nThe System’s Application log as system references the initial User’s appdata with the System user and SID (S-1-5-18) and user on a failed MSI install. So far in our testing we were able to reduce false positives but looking for a specific UUID4 format due to how this MSI installer activates but this may result in noise at times.\n\nFinal stage of attack shows the completion of the installer transaction as SYSTEM with a reference to the initializing user.\n\n**Application Eventlog**\n\nSearch for EventID 1033 and the keyword ‘test pkg’\n\nWe will update this post as we find out more information. \n\n[*This was originally published on Blumira's blog.*](https://www.blumira.com/windows-zero-day-admin-rights/)",

The only option to guarantee you're free and clear is to do a full physical swap or send it off to a specialist who can do a full offline firmware & bios validation.  We were able to craft a payload in a few hours that not only fully covered its tracks, but the rootkit also survives a full factory reset.  I've been doing PA reverse engineering for some time now, and honestly the level of skill needed to write a persistent rootkit is extremely low.  A disk swap is also not enough, although the bios vector requires a much more sophisticated attacker.\n\nEdit: PSIRT has updated guidance on CVE-2024-3400 to acknowledge that persistence through updates & factory resets are possible.  Please be aware that if you patched early on, it is highly unlikely that you've been targeted by a attacker who was able to enable the persistence of any malware, or further, would have been able to implement the mechanisms necessary for it to evade all detection.\n\nPlease see official guidance for more information:  \n[https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/CVE-2024-3400](https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/CVE-2024-3400)\n\n  \nEdit 2: If you need help or if you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me directly over chat or by sending me a message and I'll give you my signal contact information, I likely won't see most replies on this thread.",

Local-in policies aren’t bulletproof. What happens when a zero-day exploit targets the logic of those policies? What if an attacker spoofs an allowed IP?

The argument of “needing remote access” doesn’t hold water anymore when secure, scalable solutions exist to address this need. Vendors like Fortinet take heat when these types of vulns are exploited but let’s not ignore the bigger picture, the end-user’s responsibility to follow basic cybersecurity best practices. Vendors provide recommendations, secure configurations, and clear documentation on how to manage devices safely. Ignoring these guidelines and exposing management interfaces to the internet is reckless and amplifies the damage when vulnerabilities inevitably arise. It’s 2025. We know better. Stop publishing firewall management interfaces to the public internet. Use secure methods to manage your devices. It’s not hard, it’s just good security hygiene.

Special thanks to Tony Francisco with the** [**MSP Media Network**](https://www.youtube.com/@MSPMediaNetwork) **for asking the \"what if\" question.**\n\n**UPDATE 03/17/2023 1316 ET: To clarify, the CVE-2023-23397 vulnerability relies on** ***what application*** **the user is utilizing to check their email (namely, Outlook.exe) -- it is irrelevant of where the email is hosted. Please refer to Microsoft's** [**official advisory**](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2023-23397) **for the list of security updates that need to be installed on end user systems.**\n\n**UPDATE 03/17/2023 1112 ET: Security researchers Will Dormann and  Dominic Chell have** [**reported**](https://twitter.com/domchell/status/1636742613121236992) **that this vulnerability can still be used as a privilege escalation method even after the patch, but the adversary must trigger it via a** [**local hostname**](https://twitter.com/wdormann/status/1636741880674222081) **in the network.**\n\nOur team is currently tracking [CVE-2023-23397](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2023-23397), a critical vulnerability in Microsoft Outlook that requires no user interaction. To mitigate this threat, **please patch your systems**, as a patch was released earlier this week on Patch Tuesday.\n\n**What It Does**\n\nThreat actors are exploiting this vulnerability by sending a malicious email—which, again, ***does not need to be opened***. From here, attackers capture Net-NTLMv2 hashes, which enable authentication in Windows environments. This allows threat actors to potentially authenticate themselves as the victims, escalate privileges, or further compromise the environment.\n\n**What** **You** **Should Do**\n\nAt the risk of sounding like a broken record, ***patch***. This past Tuesday, Microsoft released a patch that mitigates the vulnerability, so it’s ***critical*** that you patch your systems.\n\nWe’re already monitoring our Huntress partners for signs of this CVE being exploited on their systems, but please patch as soon as possible. For those who are not Huntress partners, a potential detector to help you get started is published [here](https://github.com/huntresslabs/threat-intel/blob/main/2023/2023-03/cve-23397/win_cve_23397_davclnt_wav.yml).\n\nYou can check out our security researchers’ proof-of-concept and deep-dive over on our blog: [https://www.huntress.com/blog/everything-we-know-about-cve-2023-23397](https://www.huntress.com/blog/everything-we-know-about-cve-2023-23397)",

It appears the test evaluation is now expecting a DWORD registry entry instead of REG\\_SZ, which is strange as from what I can tell, Microsoft clarified that it should be a REG\\_SZ value.\n\n  \n**\\*\\*EDIT - 13 DEC 2024 at 8:50 A.M. CST:**  I discovered that Microsoft changed their statements twice on what type of registry data type should be used.  Referring to this URL, scroll toward the bottom and review the 'Revisions' section.  It does like the registry entries should be of type **DWORD**.  Here's how it went:\n\n  \n\"  \n2.2   Apr 11, 2024\n\nUpdated FAQs to inform customers that EnableCertPaddingCheck is data type REG\\_SZ (a string value) and not data type dword. When you specify 'EnableCertPaddingCheck\" as in \"DataItemName1\"=\"DataType1:DataValue1\" do not include the date type value or colon. This is an informational change only.\n\n\"\n\nThen more recently, they went back on that again:\n\n\"\n\n2.3   Nov 12, 2024\n\n**Corrected** Correcting the published information from the previous revision. EnableCertPaddingCheck is data type REG\\_DWORD (an integer value) and not data type string: \"EnableCertPaddingCheck\"=dword:1. The FAQ section has been updated accordingly. This is an informational change only.\n\n\"\n\n  \nThe page is indeed corrected to show the proper registry entries to enable the mitigation for 32-bit and 64-bit Windows systems.\n\n  \nMy request to CrowdStrike:  please release a Tech Alert when Spotlight test evaluations change due to technical changes required to remedy a CVE.",

Please note that while these registry settings would mitigate exploitation of this issue, it could affect regular functionality for certain use cases related to these applications. Add the following application names to this registry key as values of type REG_DWORD with data 1.:\n\n> Computer\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\Main\\FeatureControl\\FEATURE_BLOCK_CROSS_PROTOCOL_FILE_NAVIGATION\n\n* Excel.exe\n* Graph.exe\n* MSAccess.exe\n* MSPub.exe\n* PowerPnt.exe\n* Visio.exe\n* WinProj.exe\n* WinWord.exe\n* Wordpad.exe\n\n\nThe question is what \"certain use cases\" the registry entries above could actually affect.

    "text": "If you run Ubuntu OS, make sure to update your system and especially your kernel.\n\nResearchers have identified a critical privilege escalation vulnerability in the Ubuntu kernel regarding OverlayFS. It basically allows a low privileged user account on your system to obtain root privileges.\n\nPublic exploit code was published already. The LPE is quite easy to exploit.\n\nIf you want to test whether your system is affected, you may execute the following PoC code from a low privileged user account on your Ubuntu system. If you get an output, telling you the root account's id, then you are affected.\n\n    # original poc payload\n    unshare -rm sh -c \"mkdir l u w m && cp /u*/b*/p*3 l/;\n    setcap cap_setuid+eip l/python3;mount -t overlay overlay -o rw,lowerdir=l,upperdir=u,workdir=w m && touch m/*;\" && u/python3 -c 'import os;os.setuid(0);os.system(\"id\")'\n    \n    # adjusted poc payload by twitter user; likely false positive\n    unshare -rm sh -c \"mkdir l u w m && cp /u*/b*/p*3 l/;\n    setcap cap_setuid+eip l/python3;mount -t overlay overlay -o rw,lowerdir=l,upperdir=u,workdir=w m && touch m/*; u/python3 -c 'import os;os.setuid(0);os.system(\\\"id\\\")'\"\n\nIf you are unable to upgrade your kernel version or Ubuntu distro, you can alternatively adjust the permissions and deny low priv users from using the OverlayFS feature.\n\nFollowing commands will do this:\n\n    # change permissions on the fly, won't persist reboots\n    sudo sysctl -w kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=0\n    \n    # change permissions permanently; requires reboot\n    echo kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=0 | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/99-disable-unpriv-userns.conf\n\nIf you then try the PoC exploit command from above, you will receive a permission denied error.\n\nKeep patching and stay secure!\n\nReferences:\n\n* [https://twitter.com/liadeliyahu/status/1684841527959273472](https://twitter.com/liadeliyahu/status/1684841527959273472)\n* [https://www.vicarius.io/vsociety/posts/2712](https://www.vicarius.io/vsociety/posts/2712)\n* [https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32629](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32629)\n* [https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-2640](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-2640)\n* [https://www.wiz.io/blog/ubuntu-overlayfs-vulnerability](https://www.wiz.io/blog/ubuntu-overlayfs-vulnerability)\n\nEdit: There are reports of Debian users that the above PoC command also yields the root account's id. I've also tested some Debian machines and can confirm the behaviour. This is a bit strange, will have a look into it more.\n\nEdit2: I've anylized the adjusted PoC command, which was taken from Twitter. It seems that the [adjusted payload by a Twitter user](https://twitter.com/VietPetrus/status/1684938991517491202?s=20) is a false positive. The original payload was adjusted and led to an issue where the python os command id is executed during namespace creation via unshare. However, this does not reflect the actual issue. The python binary must be copied from OverlayFS with SUID permissions **afterwards**. I've adjusted the above PoC command to hold the original and adjusted payloads.",

    "text": "I really wanted to draft up a post on this with my personal experiences of o3. It has truly been a model that has well, blew my mind, in my opinion, model-wise; this was the biggest release after GPT-4. I do lots of technical low-level coding work for my job, most of the models after GPT-4 felt like incremental increasements. \n\nCan you feel like GPT-4o is better than GPT-4 by a lot? Of course yes, can it do some work that I have to think through an hour to solve? There isn't even a chance.\n\no3 has felt like a model that is at the borderline of innovators ([L4 by OpenAI's official AI Stages Definition](https://briansolis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/450569783_841433614166911_6534768519297976338_n.jpg)). I have been working on a very low-level program written in Rust to build a compression algorithm on my own for fun. I got stuck with a bug for around a couple hours straight and the program just kept bugging out during compression. I passed the code to o3 and **o3 asked me for the initial couple hundred raw bytes (1s and 0s in regular ppl terms) of the produced compressed file**, i was very confused as I don't think you can really read raw bytes and find something useful. \n\nIt turned out that there was a really minor mistake I made that caused the produced compressed to be offset by a couple bytes, therefore the decompression program fails to read it. I would have personally never noticed this mistake without o3.\n\nThere has been lots of other similar experiences, such as [a programmer using o3 to test it accidentally found a Linux vulnerability](https://sean.heelan.io/2025/05/22/how-i-used-o3-to-find-cve-2025-37899-a-remote-zeroday-vulnerability-in-the-linux-kernels-smb-implementation/), lots of my friends working in other technical fields has noted that o3 is more of an \"partner\" than work assitant.\n\n**I would argue this one fact to conclude: The difference between a regular human and 110 IQ human is simply one is more efficient than the other. Yet the difference between a 110 IQ human and a 160 IQ is one of them can began to innovate and discover new knowledge.**\n\n  \n**With AI, we are getting close to crossing that boundary, so now we began to see some sparks happening:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d9yx4dswws2f1.png?width=2006&format=png&auto=webp&s=be412232f6183338303a1a63080495579c41ea03",

Two major issues stood out:\n\n**Middleware Vulnerability (CVE-2025-29927):**  \nRecently, Next.js had a serious vulnerability where attackers could potentially bypass **authentication and authorization**. While patches have been released, it took nearly a **month** for the team to fully address all supported versions. That lag is... concerning, especially when security is at stake.\n\n**Caching is a Nightmare:**  \nNext.js has multiple layers of caching, and it’s not always clear **where** caching is happening or **how** to properly invalidate it. I’ve personally run into situations where UI updates didn’t reflect properly, and I had to dig into documentation and trial-and-error debugging just to fix stale content.\n\n  \nWhat's your thought?   \n  \n***\\*You should always provide fair comments and conduct your own due diligence.***",

This approach demonstrates significant improvements in modeling both single-domain proteins and, crucially, complex multidomain protein structures. D-I-TASSER achieves this by integrating inter-domain orientation predictions generated through deep learning with domain-level folding techniques. The method has reportedly outperformed previous leading AI models like AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAFold2 on challenging multidomain targets, especially those for which limited homologous structural information is available.\n\n**What this means:** The accurate prediction of protein structures is fundamental to understanding biological processes and is vital for drug discovery and development. D-I-TASSER's enhanced ability to model complex multidomain proteins using AI represents a significant step forward in structural biology, potentially accelerating research and the creation of new therapeutics by providing more accurate molecular blueprints. \\[[Listen](https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/ai-unraveled-latest-ai-news-trends-chatgpt-gemini-gen/id1684415169)\\] \\[[2025/05/26](https://djamgatech.web.app/)\\]\n\n# What Else Happened in AI on May 26th 2025?\n\n**Figure CEO** Brett Adcock [teased](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.6k0_SAz8nrOuu_-LoNX1HRKey5KrB5I9ab4QsQ3tLxcBL9CAPTCddGlHvovjkhMz9lwB2h2y1vY51CwkFUK7ZJL5x6p7LXv5VwdnaKGZ5ZGlqRrpSWREbaT9PlgmAOmIK4RO7dcmpvfmvLpwWQuyUbgOKefm3aUQ9qquIb7ab9VbZowk4xBKzN-keCTQ7QQRe_gTyS7v6jPGKLXH0Sywr71rItmDJXwrB_i7eXiehhKi5BGuz7oUv6xcvnnGdkds0p3G45z53sdcAREP7mxSYQ/4gt/Q1V2EFjDR22kRabBoNwZJg/h33/h001.to88fVhOmvLAYkm_mO2Di2zdrjG-wLoPT61cqvdoCoo) a new picture of Figure 03, the next humanoid from the company, saying the robots are “officially walking” now.\n\n**Google Labs** [announced](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.6k0_SAz8nrOuu_-LoNX1HYE0wNAXIbyRUNevmL--pDzCWxZ3sIcF_d1UmXl0MZpCMXog4ieru_cNDHnRr9zfyBBlmbFJVtIGJbni6BIqCs8csivjRnJoM141LE9Jh3PsohUVZx7xFDcE-mNXKAlbk75EwEX1VoYb5TZ38tyuuIAniNn8CdKyzzSUZ2iwLvD6vB2GNpi2Nu48Fp9Oewn9ZCBBVS0zoG5ZElbWphBBSKr3_8dXcDVJJH7Pyq6fauxf0U5gd_3SlxJt9XlQZrgUDA/4gt/Q1V2EFjDR22kRabBoNwZJg/h34/h001.EiD-WMLjY2J5UUjFo8pIpebzaM8onFW-Eapiv1IMJIo) that Flow, its AI filmmaking tool, is now available in 71 countries through the Google AI Pro and Ultra subscriptions.\n\n**Nvidia** [released](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.ZY5Y0CT8KZaZ1y9TVLsmf3Bjf3T6NpKPcP-kylYCgUcxU0VMGSC15OXDymDx796hTWeIU4GbMpY_Q7XN22_hqi22Jf3IYCR6QgqSte-l06uLcDsex4JdlWDrWBywQGjMzLq17hWJ3IFD_RMb0gPMzht_JShrUkbzRb4dDRASlQDGNst3FMTi_uyT4p40bjkqhge1YSB-9qGte9KFOkGQagGRIW4nB8HHUPd-Z13PEvyJlkh9M7g63cy6S8u1wGaVjA877yCestMtGvmyREk1pQ/4gt/Q1V2EFjDR22kRabBoNwZJg/h35/h001.VB3Gol837VKnbatxwAnzQnfvlFd_GayL031QuXRC1uE) AceReason Nemotron, a math and code reasoning model trained entirely from reinforcement learning, on Hugging Face.\n\n**Data management** company Informatica is again [in talks](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.dSnm3kaGd0BkNqLYPjeMf-L-leG5ARdLRAfqLlPc19iapsiEMMI8Gadzc5XDHFX-Jktzqmbf48fL776itiT3qvV0FC8MoIuHPRKNXrO0RqZzAESWckRLXUOs3zBMoer5pcelF4nazUoZpnhF_zqmqnlguv59qwrWqqTQcTdzvW5gQvf72NPaO_wJSq4ecdRz3IxDPcxGS6-eIuJr2J9DCTOl7qAYCqwz_sUD6r03VnPtidqKczMuXqq8Dla1czvbRP6IScJ1F8TAMCH8PBw5sJqwFf45bCtBr0mYINt0nXwmewpuDR-X546DbfMSF0RwSjSTAOru6ByOQ1gITJAHfA/4gt/Q1V2EFjDR22kRabBoNwZJg/h36/h001.AypSE8_rith6sCwf9xO3XXvT6qJdfHdGtisRptlToS0) for a potential sale, with Salesforce leading among potential buyers.\n\n**Capegemini and SAP** [announced](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.dSnm3kaGd0BkNqLYPjeMfyOlytRTK_g5G9_mkq7dXf9nlFHYnlpqm5THTs-cATamXM-4XdtZKWDeFg3nRfpRzAQaquJNYb_2DgvcU4CBvF-TfRLw6FfkvTFN0P-d9xdPCI7Uf8XDH_ZWj3nyr0ny9Dgy5V3rxfE7DtUH10eMwnie_PwLv_ImVt8ZHvQqOMdbvdn7knprdl6yniAxGhJ-hI4boS9gcqLH6IRnItsV0s6DUANp8Uc4PbEDmbUsjtDnvaUHY7ZIDsSDcSDiCf7qEVwmDcBljDMHlHXnAGwH9hOJTWBMQqWRJBFbLfA7nRnMQwKXayTS78bzQqOXXM_qLUFlJfBHIH7XddJhUSiIeDQ/4gt/Q1V2EFjDR22kRabBoNwZJg/h37/h001.7MOoZ-oN0IlttboRO73mQrR7l2SFfZdAsOOOz0O1GQM) a partnership with Mistral to deploy custom models for regulated industries like financial services, public sector, aerospace, and defence.\n\n**Oracle** is reportedly [looking](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.dSnm3kaGd0BkNqLYPjeMf7taxOHRgwqylc_3a-KblVc7fa9XF6HIWuuCAaV51cACpFwXcPFnVl1Fau-_8PcDgD3ct72BrFcpLuVS-vAcCXeJEwpVdN4H5Fdy-sJDuJvzabML9xU94OoHgjx8_fETmdr3NbKrp8O0sq8I_DH7I5iwemUi2CCUYKGX1MldL57U1muMg-vy7Xej8Rya0BMi1TLD4cOKsIemCwRjTKnP2f3d4jNBJU8SOwSmbsRM8c_w69a6ZHoVNeCMtbQyn7JxqlWFHXzV_v3Bh9Xotw29ON6V4uhqeWtBUijMxhvGvIPILr_05h7as19KajUeCu2q3w/4gt/Q1V2EFjDR22kRabBoNwZJg/h38/h001.peVTsQAhj-xXtMchwQMIsuwh8QsaLyQr3qPcjpWsRGA) to spend $40B to procure 400K Nvidia GPUs to power OpenAI’s Stargate data center project in the U.S.\n\n#  📚Ace the Google Cloud Generative AI Leader Certification\n\nThis book discuss the Google Cloud Generative AI Leader certification, a first-of-its-kind credential designed for professionals who aim to strategically implement Generative AI within their organizations.

    "title": "Cl0p ransomware: The skeezy invader that bites while you sleep",
    "text": "*Since surfacing in 2019, Cl0p has extorted hundreds of millions of dollars from sectors ranging from healthcare and finance to manufacturing and education. Cl0p is known for its novel zero-day attacks and aggressive extortion methods. It is one of the most resilient and damaging ransomware threats of all time.*\n\n[Christine Barry, May 16, 2025](https://blog.barracuda.com/2025/05/16/cl0p-ransomware--the-skeezy-invader-that-bites-while-you-sleep)\n\nCl0p ransomware is a private ransomware operation run by an organized cybercrime group known as [TA505](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-158a). The Cl0p operation is just one of several units of the TA505 criminal enterprise, and it is thought to be the most profitable. Since its emergence in 2019, Cl0p has extorted [over $500 million in ransom payments](https://cybelangel.com/cl0p-ransomware/) and has directly affected thousands of organizations and tens of millions of individuals globally. In the final quarter of 2024, [Cl0p outpaced Akira and overtook RansomHub](https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/101371-ransomware-extortion-rose-by-46-in-q4-2024) to become the most active ransomware group in the landscape. In the first quarter of 2025, Cl0p surpassed LockBit as the most prolific ransomware group, based on [publicly disclosed breaches](https://blog.checkpoint.com/research/the-state-of-ransomware-in-the-first-quarter-of-2025-a-126-increase-in-ransomware-yoy).\n\nResearchers believe the brand name [comes from the Russian word ‘клоп](https://thehackernews.com/2024/04/cl0ps-ransomware-rampage-security.html)’, or ‘klop,’ which translates to ‘bedbug’ in English. Like [Rhysida](https://blog.barracuda.com/2024/05/09/rhysida-ransomware--the-creepy-crawling-criminal-hiding-in-the-d), [Medusa](https://blog.barracuda.com/2025/02/25/medusa-ransomware-and-its-cybercrime-ecosystem) and [BianLian](https://blog.barracuda.com/2024/08/09/bianlian--the-face-changing-ransomware-menace), the name is probably meant to convey the characteristics adopted by the group. Most analysts have said the small but mighty (and gross) bedbug is supposed to represent stealth and persistence.\n\nCl0p is also stylized as Clop or CLOP, but the group often refers to itself with a zero (0) replacing the letter ‘o.’ This is an old school evasion tactic to slide past keyword filters that wouldn’t recognize the similarities between Clop and Cl0p, and it’s a nod to the [hacker practice of replacing letters with numbers and symbols](https://www.dcode.fr/leet-speak-1337#q1). The group doesn’t seem too committed to this though, because they’ve also used their ransom notes using [CLOP\\^\\_](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cryptomix-clop-ransomware-says-its-targeting-networks-not-computers/) , [Clop](https://fourcore.io/images/clop/note.png) and [C|0p](https://i0.wp.com/securityaffairs.co/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/clop-ransomware.jpg?resize=910%2C548&ssl=1). \n\n[Excerpt of Cl0p ransom note using the style 'CLOP', via CISA](https://preview.redd.it/bq34qzcj0f3f1.png?width=859&format=png&auto=webp&s=a19daa5f358246b4666ce6a8abe5aee618d49011)\n\n[Excerpt of Cl0p ransom note using the style CLOP\\^\\_ , via Bleeping Computer](https://preview.redd.it/yowf1cdl0f3f1.png?width=648&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b55021fd7022024bb0fa00df647fae5eb15ae2c)\n\n# Who is Cl0p?\n\nTo answer this question, we start with the cybercriminal enterprise known as TA505. This is a Russian-speaking group that has been active since 2014, conducting attacks with several malware families including [Dridex](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/Dridex-malware) and [Locky](https://cyberpedia.reasonlabs.com/EN/locky.html). Aside from Cl0p, [TA505's criminal activities include](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-158a) initial access brokering (IAB), phishing and [malspam](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/threats/malspam) distribution at scale, financial fraud, and [large-scale botnet operations](https://blog.barracuda.com/2025/03/21/top-threats-of-the-2024-botnet-landscape).\n\nThe Cl0p ransomware strain surfaced in 2019 and is thought to have evolved from CrypBoss and CryptoMix ransomware. These two strains emerged in 2015 and 2016 and died off by 2018. Some researchers believe Cl0p is a direct successor to CryptoMix, but it seems more likely that the earlier operators split into several different RaaS groups. Whatever the origin story, Cl0p ransomware has endured and adapted, and is now considered the ‘flagship’ of the TA505 operations. It’s the most well-known attack tool in their arsenal, and it demonstrates the group’s technical sophistication and adaptability in attack methods. Cl0p has inflicted significant damage across the world through its high-profile supply chain attacks.\n\nResearchers put TA505 and Cl0p ransomware in Russia or the [Commonwealth of Independent States](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Commonwealth-of-Independent-States) (CIS). Cl0p ransomware is specifically programmed not to execute on Russian-language systems, and the group’s communications and code comments contain Russian language elements and cultural references. Command-and-control servers and payment infrastructure elements have been traced back to Russia and Eastern Europe.\n\nCl0p actors also avoid targeting organizations within Russia and former Soviet states, and their activity patterns have been observed to be in alignment with working hours in Eastern European time zones.\n\nDespite the probable Russian origin, Cl0p actors make it clear they are not hacktivists or affiliated with any nation-state.\n\n[Cl0p actors publish a statement denying involvement in politics, via SOCRadar](https://preview.redd.it/dbmoune21f3f1.png?width=777&format=png&auto=webp&s=62b4b1bec7fb2deb1719aa2ae13efdbbb67b5726)\n\nCl0p's ransom notes may also emphasize the group’s financial motivation: \n\n*“We do not want to make this public or spread your confidential information, we are only interested in money.*\n\n*We are not interested in political speak just money and money will bring this to finish.” \\~via* [*Ransomware.Live*](https://www.ransomware.live/ransomnote/clop/Details_Cleo.txt)\n\nConsidering these statements and a lack of evidence to the contrary, researchers believe Cl0p is motivated by financial gain and has no political objectives.\n\n# Cl0p operations\n\nCl0p is a private ransomware operation with a core team handling most aspects of their campaigns. In most major attacks, especially those involving zero-day vulnerabilities, the core TA505 team maintains end-to-end control. For certain operations, Cl0p has selectively employed an affiliate model, where trusted partners are granted limited use of their ransomware code in exchange for a percentage of ransom proceeds. This may be the case when Cl0p / TA505 has a specific operation in mind and the group needs more ‘hands on deck’ to get the job done.\n\nThis flexible approach puts Cl0p somewhere between pure Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) operations that rely on affiliates and private ransomware groups that operate exclusively as closed teams. Some researchers and industry analysts refer to Cl0p as a RaaS operation because Cl0p does use affiliates as needed.\n\nCl0p also stands out for several other reasons. The group specializes in exploiting previously unknown [zero-day vulnerabilities](https://www.barracuda.com/support/glossary/zero-day-threat?utm_source=05162025a&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=blog), which they’ve successfully deployed in several supply chain attacks. They use aggressive extortion tactics, including encryption, data exfiltration, [distributed-denial-of-service (DDoS)](https://www.barracuda.com/support/glossary/ddos?utm_source=05162025a&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=blog), and stakeholder harassment. This harassment involves contacting the affected employees, customers, partners and media to pressure the breached company into paying.\n\n# How Does Cl0p Work?\n\nCl0p’s primary distribution and infection methods have evolved from sophisticated phishing attacks to advanced zero-day exploits. The phishing campaigns used malicious email attachments, links to compromised sites and a range of social engineering tactics. Cl0p is known to use data stolen from existing victims to create a convincing message and call to action. This makes their attacks more effective against partners, customers, vendors, and others who may offer a pathway into the target’s network.\n\nIn Cl0p’s early years, phishing campaigns relied on [macro-enabled](https://blog.barracuda.com/2023/11/17/malware-101-file-type-evasion) Microsoft Excel and Word files. These were delivered through an html attachment that redirected the user to the documents, or they were directly attached to the message.  \n\n[Early Cl0p phishing email delivering a macro-enabled document, via Bleeping Computer](https://preview.redd.it/khlitc3n3f3f1.png?width=536&format=png&auto=webp&s=303b727f54a4cc3eb61ee7daae70b7439bd58179)\n\nOn devices with macros enabled, the document downloaded the following tools from a Cl0p-controlled server:\n\n* [Get2](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/ransomware-spotlight/ransomware-spotlight-clop): A malware loader, downloader, or ‘first-stage malware.’ The primary purpose of Get2 is to download and execute other malicious software onto a victim’s server.\n* [SDBot](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/threats/malware-encyclopedia-description?name=Backdoor%3AWin32%2FSdbot): This is a family of backdoor Trojans used for remote access and lateral movement. Microsoft has [details on the child variants here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/threats/threat-search?query=Backdoor:Win32/Sdbot).\n* [FlawedAmmyy RAT](https://www.cyber.nj.gov/threat-landscape/malware/trojans/flawedammyy): A remote access trojan (RAT) used for data theft and command execution.\n* [ServHelper](https://www.gdatasoftware.com/blog/2020/07/36122-hidden-miners): A malware family that facilitates remote access and backdoor capabilities.  It also works to harvest credentials and establish persistence of the threat in the system.\n\nCl0p will also use Initial Access Brokers (IABs) to gain access to targeted organizations.\n\n# Cl0p strikes gold with zero-day vulnerabilities\n\nAlthough Cl0p continues to run phishing attacks, the zero-day attack has become the group’s signature approach. Many ransomware groups exploit known vulnerabilities on unpatched systems. Cl0p has repeatedly developed and deployed exploits against previously unknown vulnerabilities. Here are the big ones:\n\n[**Accellion FTA**](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa21-055a) **(December 2020)**: This file transfer appliance was nearing end-of-life when several vulnerabilities were identified and exploited by Cl0p. The attack was launched on December 23, right before the U.S. Christmas holiday. The group gained access to approximately 100 organizations that used Accellion FTA. Vulnerabilities: CVE-2021-27101/27102/27103/27104\n\n[**GoAnywhere MFT**](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fortra-shares-findings-on-goanywhere-mft-zero-day-attacks/) **(January 2023)**: Fortra’s Managed File Transfer solution was under active exploitation for two weeks before the vendor realized the breach. Cl0p was able to gain access to over 130 companies through this exploit. Vulnerability: CVE-2023-0669\n\n[Cl0p ransom note referencing GoAnywhere MFT software, via CISA](https://preview.redd.it/njq2z9a94f3f1.png?width=847&format=png&auto=webp&s=dacf33130daaeda1df53be8f61bbb1f65fba8f6a)\n\n[**MOVEit Transfer (May 2023)**](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/clop-ransomware-claims-responsibility-for-moveit-extortion-attacks/): Cl0p exploited yet another file transfer system service provider at the end of May 2023, during the U.S. Memorial Day holiday. The vulnerability existed in both the cloud and on-premises versions of MOVEit, and Cl0p was able to access [thousands of companies, affecting millions of individuals](https://www.wired.com/story/moveit-breach-victims/).  You can see [a diagram of this supply chain attack here](https://horizon3.ai/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screen-Shot-2023-06-09-at-7.45.34-AM.png). Vulnerability: CVE-2023-34362\n\n[Post on Cl0p's leak site referencing Progress MOVEit software, via ZeroFox Intelligence](https://preview.redd.it/pppdin9c4f3f1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=09555136cd284965ec7b5dbe9beb40805b64e024)\n\n[**Cleo Software (2024-2025)**](https://foresiet.com/blog/cl0p-ransomwares-reign-of-cyber-extortion-analyzing-the-recent-cleo-software-exploits): Cl0p is actively exploiting two vulnerabilities in three [Cleo Software](https://www.cleo.com/) products:\n\n* **Cleo LexiCom**: A desktop client for secure file transfers, normally used to exchange sensitive documents with vendors, customers and other business partners.\n* **Cleo VLTrader**: Server-based managed file transfer (MFT) software that supports multiple protocols for automated workflows.\n* **Cleo Harmony**: An enterprise-grade platform that integrates with enterprise resource planning (ERP) solutions like SAP and Salesforce.\n\nBoth vulnerabilities were used to establish backdoors and steal data from Cleo customers. This attack is ongoing as of May 2025. Vulnerabilities: CVE-2024- 50623 /55956.\n\n[Excerpt of Cl0p ransom note referencing Cleo Software, Ransomware.Live](https://preview.redd.it/xmsd4gdk4f3f1.png?width=658&format=png&auto=webp&s=1097891eb8d17d2fce63b43fe1488d723879ca7e)\n\nThese four supply chain attacks gave Cl0p access to thousands of victims, and the speed of each attack was important. Most vendors quickly released a patch and communicated with customers, so the window of opportunity for Cl0p was shrinking by the hour. Instead of taking the extra time to encrypt data, Cl0p focused on stealing data and using this and sometimes other types of extortion.\n\nBecause speed was so important in these attacks, Cl0p would turn to affiliates to assist in data exfiltration, and this is where the hybrid RaaS model comes into play. The Cl0p core team did not have the capacity to attack all of the potential victims right away, and affiliates can provide a percentage of ransoms from a larger pool of victims. \n\nResearchers have also noticed patterns in the timing of Cl0p attacks. Phishing emails are sent during the common working hours in the targeted region, so they can snag the most victims while they’re at the desk. Cl0p will attack vulnerabilities during off-hours or long holidays, when IT staff may be reduced or unavailable.\n\nBeyond initial access, the Cl0p attack chain proceeds like this:\n\n* **Lateral Movement**: Cl0p explores the network with tools like [Mimikatz](https://www.varonis.com/blog/what-is-mimikatz), [PsExec](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psexec), and [Cobalt Strike](https://www.cobaltstrike.com/).   \n* **Evasion and persistence**: Cl0p [disables Windows Defender and backup processes](https://www.threatdown.com/what-is-cl0p-ransomware/), and uses code obfuscation to hide indicators of malicious intent.\n* **Data Exfiltration**: Steal sensitive data using custom tools like the Teleport exfiltration tool.\n* **Encryption**: If files are encrypted, they are renamed with extensions clop, CIIp, C\\_L\\_O\\_P or a similar variation.\n\n[Cl0p encrypted files on a desktop, via HowToRemove.Guide.](https://preview.redd.it/kkc1dsmr4f3f1.png?width=813&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b042a0458f61440c6282510b3f2719368f7e18e)\n\nRansom notes are usually named \\`Cl0pReadMe.txt\\` or \\`README\\_README.txt.’ Victim information is then posted on the Cl0p leak site.\n\n[Cl0p leak site, via Bleeping Computer](https://preview.redd.it/7v7gaasw4f3f1.png?width=918&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc23295dd909968e5b6a85ba3dc59c3483644b41)\n\nWhen there is no encryption, Cl0p proceeds with one or more extortion tactics. This could be data leaks, DDoS attacks, or harassment of victims. When ransom negotiations fail, Cl0p makes the data available for download.\n\n[Cl0p leaks ExecuPharm data through its leak site, via Bleeping Computer](https://preview.redd.it/v4y4kejz4f3f1.png?width=572&format=png&auto=webp&s=54fa9b82754adcc9173b0d5a3e8e914723c150ec)\n\nCl0p consistently ranks among the most damaging and adaptive ransomware threats in the cyber landscape. It has the technical abilities to deploy exploits quickly and scale operations as needed. It's also part of a larger group, TA505, which operates a variety of cybercrime operations that can be leveraged on-demand. Resilience, technical innovation and access to many different resources make Cl0p a serious threat to all companies.\n\n# Protect yourself\n\nFollowing best practices and using multiple layers of security will mitigate the risks. Stay vigilant and apply security patches quickly, especially for all file-transfer solutions and other supply chain software. Solutions like [Barracuda Managed XDR](https://www.barracuda.com/products/managed-xdr?utm_source=05162025a&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=blog) can detect these attacks and prevent the encryption and theft of your data.\n\n[This post was originally published on the Barracuda Blog.](https://blog.barracuda.com/2025/05/16/cl0p-ransomware--the-skeezy-invader-that-bites-while-you-sleep)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/27kmbwh55f3f1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=f60d7e66235813e5eccd9c317e5f18845bc95d2c\n\n[Christine Barry](https://blog.barracuda.com/author/christine)\n\nChristine Barry Senior Chief Cybersecurity Storyteller and Content Manager at Barracuda.  Prior to joining Barracuda, Christine was a field engineer and project manager for K12 and SMB clients for over 15 years.  She holds several technology and project management credentials, a Bachelor of Arts, and a Master of Business Administration.

Esta vulnerabilidad, clasificada como crítica, permite la ejecución remota de código, lo que facilita a los atacantes realizar diversas actividades maliciosas sin necesidad de credenciales previas.\n\nLos atacantes, conocidos como \"Mimo Hackers\", están utilizando esta brecha de seguridad para cargar varios tipos de malware en los servidores comprometidos. Estos incluyen mineros que utilizan los recursos de los sistemas para generar criptomonedas de manera encubierta, el Mimo Loader, que descarga y ejecuta módulos adicionales de forma dinámica, y proxyware que convierte los dispositivos infectados en proxies para actividades ilegales.\n\nAnte esta situación, se ha recomendado a los administradores de sitios web que actualicen inmediatamente Craft CMS a la versión más reciente y realicen auditorías de seguridad con herramientas como OpenVAS o Nessus. También se sugiere implementar sistemas de detección de intrusos y monitorear el tráfico de red en busca de actividades sospechosas.\n\nLa amenaza es significativa para la infraestructura digital en España, donde el uso de CMS personalizados está en aumento. Instituciones como el Instituto Nacional de Ciberseguridad (INCIBE) están alertando a empresas sobre la necesidad de adoptar buenas prácticas de seguridad para cerrar estas brechas y proteger sus sistemas. \n\nSi conoces a alguien que utilice Craft CMS, es crucial que compartas esta información y que tomen las medidas necesarias para resguardar sus sitios ante este tipo de amenazas.",
