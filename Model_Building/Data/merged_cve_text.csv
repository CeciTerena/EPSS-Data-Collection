CVE-2020-14979,2025-03-11,reddit,"Why does Defender hate Fan Control? An explanation of Windows Drivers, WinRing0.sys, and its 7.8 CVE score: #TL;DR Windows Defender is not wrong, per se. `WinRing0` DOES has a vulnerability that lets unprivileged programs hack into Windows. Fan Control is not malicious, WinRing0 is not malicious, but a malicious program can use WinRing0 to bypass your system's security measures because it has a vulnerability. Read source 1 for the technical details. You don't have to read this entire wall of text, skip to the headers that interests you. Introduction Hello everyone! As you probably found out by now, Fan Control's implementation is currently broken. This is due to the kernel driver that Fan Control uses WinRing0 being blocked by Windows Defender. I want to clarify a few things I learned while researching this and show a bit of behind the scenes of how your computer talks to Fan Control and why Defender has blocked it. Pet Peeve First off, as a computer scientist it pains me to see people's knee jerk reaction is to override their operating system's security systems. It's there to protect you, yes it can make mistakes, but you should generally wait for an official response or similar understanding and you shouldn't do it blindly. Your security means nothing if you override your security when it's inconvenient. It's kind of like taking the carbon monoxide alarm off the wall because you don't like that it's beeping super loudly. Anyways. What is a driver and why do we need them? ^ To answer why Defender has blocked fan Control, I first have to explain how Fan Control works with Windows. I'll try to keep this explanation as simple as possible. ^ Window's main job is to manage a bunch of different applications and allow them to talk to the hardware. In old times it used to be the case that a program can tell the computer to do whatever it wants. This was a problem because it could mess up other programs, crash the entire system, and do malicious things. So to fix this, operating systems now split up the computer's memory and give a piece to each application. This application now has its own space to do things, called user-space. Each application is only allowed to do things in its own piece of memory and nothing else. If the application crashed, the OS can throw away the application & its piece of memory and everything else on the system will be fine. This has a big problem though: applications isolated in user-space could not talk to hardware! If you can talk to the hardware, you can do anything to the system, so it's an intentional protection. But your hardware needs to talk to the operating system to work, but there is too many pieces of hardware that all work differently. Windows doesn't know how to talk to all of them! So we need these programs that can interface with hardware but can't live in user-space. But at the same time we want the kind of protection that user-space gives. The solution is drivers: special programs that can receive special exceptions to live in kernel-space. Kernel-space is the opposite of user-space. You can do anything in kernel-space! Like talk to hardware to control your fans or read your credit card number when you pay for something. Because kernel-space drivers are so high risk Microsoft gate keeps them with an iron fist, kinda like Apple's non-EU app store on iPhones. Fan Control used a driver called WinRing0 Fan Control cannot talk directly to your hardware. It can talk to a driver, and that driver can talk to the hardware. There are a few different drivers and api's Fan Control uses, but the main one was WinRing0. Who made WinRing0? WinRing0 is a third party driver developed by OpenLibSys. Who convinced Microsoft to let WinRing0 be a driver with privileges? The company called EVGA convinced Microsoft. Why? Because EVGA made software that used the third party driver. They don't use it anymore because it was vulnerable. WinRing0 is a vulnerable driver! This is why Defender hates WinRing0. On August 11th, 2020 a security researcher named Matt Hand published¹ the vulnerability report for WinRing0 proving that it had a high-risk privilege escalation exploit. This means a user-space program can take control of this driver and then use it to gain kernel-space privileges. This means a lowly application can take advantage of WinRing0 to do whatever it wants to your computer! When this was discovered, EVGA abandoned WinRing0 and made their own proprietary driver that they use. The developers of WinRing0 can fix the driver, but under Microsoft's modern strict driver rules, an updated WinRing0 won't make it past Microsoft's driver gate keepers. Many projects used and still use this driver. That's why Microsoft couldn't just cut support outright for the driver- too many things would break all at once. But WinRing0 was on borrowed time, Microsoft planned to cut the driver in 2024, but then they pushed it back to Jan 2025. And now Microsoft seems to start following through. What are the risks of running a vulnerable driver? Well a vulnerable driver is basically a front door to your house that you cannot lock. If everyone in town is friendly, you're good. But all it takes is one malicious actor to recognize the vulnerable door and waltz right on in. The door still functions, and friendly programs like Fan Control are respectful when they have to go in your house through the door. But you are less protected while having it installed. I would recommend listening to Defender. If you choose to override Defender, know that your OS's front door is open, and any program you run can use it for whatever they wish.

CVE-2025-29927,2025-04-02,reddit,"Lessons from Next.js Middleware vulnerability CVE-2025-29927: Why Route-Level Auth Checks Are Worth the Extra Work Hey r/nextjs community, With the recent disclosure of CVE-2025-29927 , I wanted to share some thoughts on an authentication patterns that I always use in all my projects and that can help keep your apps secure, even in the face of framework-level vulnerabilities like this. For those who haven't heard, Vercel recently disclosed a critical vulnerability in Next.js middleware. By adding a special header to requests, attackers can completely bypass middleware-based authentication checks. This affects apps that rely on middleware for auth or security checks without additional validation at the route level. We can all agree that middleware-based auth is convenient , this vulnerability highlights why checking auth at the route level provides an additional layer of security. Yes, it's more verbose and requires more code, but it creates a defense-in-depth approach that's resilient to middleware bypasses. Here's a pattern I've been using, some people always ask why I don't just use the middleware, but that incident proves its effectiveness. First, create a requireAuth function: export async function requireAuth { const session = await auth; if { return redirect; } if ) { return { authorized: false, session }; } return { authorized: true, session }; } // Helper function to check roles function userHasRoles { const userRoles = user?.roles || ; const userRolesName = userRoles.map => role.role.name); return roles.every => userRolesName.includes); } Then, implement it in every route that needs protection: export default async function AdminPage { const { authorized } = await requireAuth; if return <Unauthorized />; // Your protected page content return ; } Benefits of This Approach 1. Resilience to middleware vulnerabilities: Even if middleware is bypassed, each route still performs its own auth check 2. Fine-grained control: Different routes can require different roles or permissions 3. Explicit security: Makes the security requirements of each route clear in the code 4. Early returns: Auth failures are handled before any sensitive logic executes I use Next.js Full-Stack-Kit for several projects and it implements this pattern consistently across all protected routes. What I like about that pattern is that auth checks aren't hidden away in some middleware config - they're right there at the top of each page component, making the security requirements explicit and reviewable. At first, It might seem tedious to add auth checks to every route , this vulnerability shows why that extra work is worth it. Defense in depth is a fundamental security principle, and implementing auth checks at multiple levels can save you from framework-level vulnerabilities. Stay safe guys!"

CVE-2025-2825,2025-04-04,reddit,"Critical Vulnerability: CrushFTP CVE-2025-31161 Auth Bypass and Post-Exploitation TL;DR: CVE-2025-31161 is a critical severity vulnerability allowing attackers to control how user authentication is handled by CrushFTP managed file transfer software. We strongly recommend patching immediately to avoid affected versions 10.0.0 through 10.8.3 and 11.0.0 through 11.3.0. Successful exploitation of CVE-2025-31161 would give attackers admin level access across the CrushFTP application for further compromise. On 3 April 2025, Huntress observed in-the-wild exploitation of CVE-2025-31161, an authentication bypass vulnerability in versions of the CrushFTP software. We uncovered further post-exploitation activity leveraging the MeshCentral agent and other malware that we will discuss in this writeup. While doing some further analysis, we uncovered potential evidence of compromise as early as 30 March 2025, which seemed to be testing access, and did not spawn any external processes to CrushFTP. In a recent post from the ShadowServer team, they state as of March 30 there were \~1,500 vulnerable instances of CrushFTP publicly exposed to the internet. We have published a proof of concept, IOCs, and analysis on Mesh and AnyDesk post exploitations in this blog. What is CVE-2025-31161? CVE-2025-31161 is a 9.8 CVSS critical severity vulnerability that affects how the CrushFTP file transfer application handles user authentication. At the time of writing, the NIST NVD entry states the description: >CrushFTP versions 10.0.0 through 10.8.3 and 11.0.0 through 11.3.0 are affected by a vulnerability in the S3 authorization header processing that allows authentication bypass. Remote and unauthenticated HTTP requests to CrushFTP with known usernames can be used to impersonate a user and conduct actions on their behalf, including administrative actions and data retrieval. This vulnerability is patched and is mitigated in CrushFTP versions 11.3.1+ and 10.8.4+. Huntress has validated and confirmed the authentication bypass is prevented in patched versions. Please ensure your own installations of CrushFTP are updated to the latest versions. If your CrushFTP instance is publicly exposed to the open Internet, we strongly recommend you patch immediately. Upon successful exploitation, an adversary may gain access to the administrator user account for the CrushFTP application, and leverage this to create new backdoor accounts, access files , obtain code execution, and achieve full control of the vulnerable server. The vulnerability was assigned a CVE on March 26, and the Shadowserver Foundation first reported CVE-2025-31161 exploitation activity on March 31. The exploitation of CVE-2025-31161 is indicative of a concerning trend that we’ve seen across several incidents, where threat actors are targeting MFT platforms as a way to deliver disruptive attacks. These platforms are typically external-facing and house sensitive enterprise data, making them a favorite for threat actors. As such, prompt patching is critical. Within our partner base we have seen 148 unique endpoints with the CrushFTP software installed as a service, with 95 of these running major versions 10 and 11. Approximately 72 different companies within our customer base were currently running unpatched versions of CrushFTP. Customers have been notified of the urgency to upgrade. Numerous other security firms have discussed CVE-2025-31161 and thanks to their shared insights, Huntress was able to recreate a proof-of-concept with ease. The core of this vulnerability is the S3 authentication functionality included as a part of CrushFTP. Due to logic bugs in the underlying source code , a mere Authorization header in an HTTP request is all that is needed to bypass authentication without valid username or password credentials. What is Huntress Doing? Post-exploitation efforts are already thoroughly covered by Huntress detection rules. In response to these intrusions specifically, we crafted detectors to find child processes invoked underneath the CrushFTP service executable. For community members not yet protected with Huntress, there are two Sigma rules available in the public SigmaHQ repository for: 1. Detecting “Remote Access Tool - MeshAgent Command Execution via MeshCentral” 2. Detecting “Remote Access Tool - AnyDesk Silent Installation” If you think you could be impacted, abuse our trial to quickly discover anything shady left behind."

CVE-2024-36347,2025-04-12,reddit,"Gigabyte X870E Aorus Master F5 BIOS random 4d error after turning on secure boot As per title. Recently updated my Gigabyte X870E Aorus Master from F5a to F5 for the ""AMD CPU microcode signature verification vulnerability "" patch. Had updated AMD Chipset Driver to 7.01.08.129 before and after the F5 BIOS update. Got random 4d error on boot up, stuck on the screen with Aorus logo without the spinning wheel. Tried reset BIOS to default settings, no help. Tried turning off PSU then hold power button for 30 secs, no good. Redownload and reflash F5 bios again then turn off memory restore context. Things seems to work well. On boot up the next day, remember I haven't turn on secure boot after reflashing BIOS. Turn it back on and the random 4d boot up error start happening again. Afterwards, I noticed some of the BIOS settings was changed after secure boot changes, including memory context restore changing back to auto. Turned it off, thought everything was stable. Turned on my PC the next day and it got stuck with 4d error again. Seems like there's something wrong with secure boot or the way I turned it on. User standard/custom mode both causes 4d error randomly. But when it boot successfully, everything works fine. Did a quick 30 min CPU+RAM and RAM test via OCCT and nothing was found.

Nothing is responsive for a few seconds. 3. I'll get a message about losing connectivity and it will retry to connect . It will eventually reconnect.

CVE-2023-48795,2025-04-14,reddit,"Cybersecurity: SSH Hardening & Offensive Mastery by DsDSec Hello everyone, I’d like to share a resource recently published by our cybersecurity group DsDSec: ""SSH Hardening & Offensive Mastery"", a free technical book focused entirely on SSH security. SSH remains a crucial access point in modern infrastructure. Properly securing it is essential, and this book aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of both its defensive and offensive aspects, going far beyond basic configurations.

CVE-2024-0132,2025-04-15,reddit,"Nvidia Patch Incompleteness Poses Risks in AI Container Security Trend Micro has discovered a critical security flaw in Nvidia's patch for the Container Toolkit that still leaves AI environments vulnerable to attacks. Key Points: - Trend Micro flags Nvidia's incomplete patch for a critical vulnerability. - The flaw allows potential container escape attacks and unauthorized access. - Organizations using Nvidia's toolkit are directly at risk, especially with default settings. - The patch doesn't properly enforce checks against race conditions, allowing exploitation. - A denial-of-service flaw has also been identified affecting Docker on Linux systems. Trend Micro researchers have flagged significant issues with Nvidia's patching of a critical vulnerability found in the Nvidia Container Toolkit, originally addressed last September. The vulnerability, identified as CVE-2024-0132, scored an alarming 9 out of 10 on the CVSS scale, categorizing it as high priority. However, Trend Micro's findings indicate that the patch is not fully effective, leaving enterprises exposed to dangerous container escape attacks. Such vulnerabilities enable hackers to execute arbitrary commands and access sensitive data, putting organizations' proprietary information at significant risk. The security gap lies in the incomplete enforcement of checks that would typically prevent exploitation via the time-of-check to time-of-use race condition. This flaw allows a crafted container to maneuver past isolation barriers and manipulate host resources. The potential fallout from such exploitation includes theft of sensitive information, prolonged system downtime, and substantial operational disruptions. Organizations relying on the Nvidia Container Toolkit for their AI workloads and Docker environments must be aware of these risks, particularly those operating with default configurations or the newer features of the toolkit. Additionally, alongside this vulnerability, Trend Micro has pointed out a related denial-of-service issue specifically affecting Docker configurations on Linux systems. Containers using specific mount options can lead to unchecked growth in the Linux mount table, creating a service disruption that can hinder remote access and overall operation. To mitigate these threats, Trend Micro advocates for stricter access controls and the disabling of unnecessary features within the Nvidia toolkit.

Blickt man weiter ins Jahr 2035, dürfte dieser Anteil in den USA bereits bei nahezu 100 Prozent der 290 Millionen Fahrzeuge liegen. Auch China zieht nach: Dort sollen bis dahin rund 72 Prozent der 350 Millionen Autos als Connected Cars unterwegs sein. Damit ist die Mehrheit der Fahrzeuge in diesen Ländern bereits vernetzt, Tendenz steigend. Dies bringt jedoch nicht nur Fortschritt und Komfort, sondern öffnet auch neue Angriffsmöglichkeiten für Kriminelle. Mit der zunehmenden Vernetzung der Fahrzeuge steigt das Risiko von Cyberangriffen, die von Datendiebstahl bis hin zur Manipulation von Fahrfunktionen reichen können. Über Bluetooth eingehackt Inwieweit sich tatsächlich sensible Fahrfunktionen kapern lassen, haben IT-Sicherheitsexperten von PCAutomotive auf der Hackerkonferenz Black Hat Asia 2025 demonstriert. Für ihre Präsentation verwendeten sie einen Nissan Leaf der zweiten Generation, Baujahr 2020. Dabei erfolgte der Angriff durch ein Einfallstor in der Bluetooth-Schnittstelle des Elektroautos. Schwachstellen im Infotainmentsystem ermöglichten darüber hinaus eine Rechteerweiterung und schließlich einen verdeckten Fernzugriff über die Mobilfunkverbindung. Dramatische Folgen für die Sicherheit der Insassen Die Folgen einer solchen Schwachstelle könnten kaum gravierender sein. Angreifer können den Standort des Fahrzeugs verfolgen und Inhalte des Infotainment-Bildschirms manipulieren oder mit Screenshots speichern. Gespräche können heimlich aufgezeichnet und sogar über den Lautsprecher des Autos wiedergegeben werden. Es kommt aber noch schlimmer: Auch physische Funktionen des Kraftfahrzeuges wie Türen, Scheibenwischer, Spiegel, Fenster und auch Leuchten können nach der Hacker-Übernahme sowohl aus dem Stand als auch während der Fahrt ferngesteuert werden. Sogar die Lenkung des Fahrzeugs soll laut netzwelt.de aus der Ferne manipulierbar sein – der Albtraum eines jeden Autofahrers. Was einst nach düsterer Science-Fiction klang, ist heute eine reale und ernstzunehmende Bedrohung. Cyberangriffe werden immer noch unterschätzt Laut der Präsentation von PCAutomotive sind die Cyberexperten auf insgesamt zehn Sicherheitslücken gestoßen. Diese sind mittlerweile unter den Codes PCA\NISSAN\009, PCA\NISSAN\012 und CVE-2025-32056 bis CVE-2025-32063 bekannt. Die Meldung an Nissan erfolgte bereits im August 2023. Dennoch hätten die Gegenmaßnahmen seitens des japanischen Autoherstellers viel Zeit in Anspruch genommen. Details will man bei Nissan aus Sicherheitsgründen nicht preisgeben. Vielleicht aber auch aus Kalkül – denn die Hersteller tun noch immer zu wenig gegen Cyberangriffe. Immer wieder werden neue Schwachstellen bei verschiedenen Marken und Modellen bekannt. Allerdings sind nicht nur die Autobauer Schuld: Cybersicherheit kostet bares Geld und setzt man die Kundenbrille auf, handelt es sich um eine Verbesserung, die man schlicht nicht sehen kann.

Über Bluetooth eingehackt Inwieweit sich tatsächlich sensible Fahrfunktionen kapern lassen, haben IT-Sicherheitsexperten von PCAutomotive auf der Hackerkonferenz Black Hat Asia 2025 demonstriert. Für ihre Präsentation verwendeten sie einen Nissan Leaf der zweiten Generation, Baujahr 2020. Dabei erfolgte der Angriff durch ein Einfallstor in der Bluetooth-Schnittstelle des Elektroautos. Schwachstellen im Infotainmentsystem ermöglichten darüber hinaus eine Rechteerweiterung und schließlich einen verdeckten Fernzugriff über die Mobilfunkverbindung. Dramatische Folgen für die Sicherheit der Insassen Die Folgen einer solchen Schwachstelle könnten kaum gravierender sein. Angreifer können den Standort des Fahrzeugs verfolgen und Inhalte des Infotainment-Bildschirms manipulieren oder mit Screenshots speichern. Gespräche können heimlich aufgezeichnet und sogar über den Lautsprecher des Autos wiedergegeben werden. Es kommt aber noch schlimmer: Auch physische Funktionen des Kraftfahrzeuges wie Türen, Scheibenwischer, Spiegel, Fenster und auch Leuchten können nach der Hacker-Übernahme sowohl aus dem Stand als auch während der Fahrt ferngesteuert werden. Sogar die Lenkung des Fahrzeugs soll laut netzwelt.de aus der Ferne manipulierbar sein – der Albtraum eines jeden Autofahrers. Was einst nach düsterer Science-Fiction klang, ist heute eine reale und ernstzunehmende Bedrohung. Cyberangriffe werden immer noch unterschätzt Laut der Präsentation von PCAutomotive sind die Cyberexperten auf insgesamt zehn Sicherheitslücken gestoßen. Diese sind mittlerweile unter den Codes PCA\NISSAN\009, PCA\NISSAN\012 und CVE-2025-32056 bis CVE-2025-32063 bekannt. Die Meldung an Nissan erfolgte bereits im August 2023. Dennoch hätten die Gegenmaßnahmen seitens des japanischen Autoherstellers viel Zeit in Anspruch genommen. Details will man bei Nissan aus Sicherheitsgründen nicht preisgeben. Vielleicht aber auch aus Kalkül – denn die Hersteller tun noch immer zu wenig gegen Cyberangriffe. Immer wieder werden neue Schwachstellen bei verschiedenen Marken und Modellen bekannt. Allerdings sind nicht nur die Autobauer Schuld: Cybersicherheit kostet bares Geld und setzt man die Kundenbrille auf, handelt es sich um eine Verbesserung, die man schlicht nicht sehen kann.

CVE-2025-24859,2025-04-15,reddit,"Critical Apache Roller Insufficient Session Expiration on Password Change Vulnerability CVE-2025-24859 A session management vulnerability exists in Apache Roller before version 6.1.5 where active user sessions are not properly invalidated after password changes. When a user's password is changed, either by the user themselves or by an administrator, existing sessions remain active and usable. This allows continued access to the application through old sessions even after password changes, potentially enabling unauthorized access if credentials were compromised. This issue affects Apache Roller versions up to and including 6.1.4. The vulnerability is fixed in Apache Roller 6.1.5 by implementing centralized session management that properly invalidates all active sessions when passwords are changed or users are disabled.

CVE-2025-21204,2025-04-15,reddit,"Discussing the New inetpub Folder in Windows 11 Windows users are urged to keep the inetpub folder. Microsoft has confirmed that the newly introduced inetpub folder is a critical security feature rather than a rogue file. Users are advised against deleting it, even if it appears empty. This measure is part of a larger effort to bolster defenses against a significant vulnerability, CVE-2025-21204, that affects system permissions. Keeping this folder is essential to maintain security integrity. Users have taken to discussions on how security measures like this can affect system administration practices and user experiences. Many share concerns about transparency in changes made by tech companies. - The inetpub folder is a part of security updates. - It prevents privilege escalation exploits. - Users without IIS are still impacted."
CVE-2025-21204,2025-04-15,reddit,"Microsoft Addresses Windows 11 Users' Concerns About New inetpub Folder Microsoft has reassured Windows users that the newly appeared inetpub folder is an intentional security measure following recent updates. Key Points: - The inetpub folder is created as part of a security update to mitigate a significant vulnerability. - Users should not delete the inetpub folder despite its empty appearance. - The folder enhances protection against privilege escalation exploits on Windows systems. Windows 10 and 11 users have recently noticed a seemingly empty directory called 'inetpub' appearing on their systems after installing Microsoft's April 2025 Patch Tuesday updates. While many users may see this folder as unnecessary and consider deleting it, Microsoft has explicitly warned against such action, clarifying that it plays a critical role in protecting systems from exploitation of a newly patched vulnerability, CVE-2025-21204. This vulnerability poses a serious risk as it allows unauthorized users to potentially gain system-level access, posing a significant threat to the integrity of a user's system. The inetpub folder is typically associated with Microsoft's Internet Information Services web server software. However, even users without IIS installed are affected by this change. The folder is created with specific read-only SYSTEM-level permissions, which enhances security measures against potential privilege escalation attempts. Microsoft reassures users that there is currently no evidence of active exploitation regarding CVE-2025-21204, but maintaining the folder's integrity is key to preventing future security risks. Thus, rather than being a cause for alarm, the folder signifies a proactive step by Microsoft in safeguarding Windows systems. How do you feel about Microsoft creating this folder as a security measure without prior user notification? Learn More: Cyber Security News Want to stay updated on the latest cyber threats?

CVE-2021-35587,2025-04-16,reddit,"Massive Oracle Cloud Breach: Threat Actor Sells 6M Records Exploited via Critical Vulnerability On March 21, 2025, CloudSEK’s XVigil uncovered a high-severity security breach involving a threat actor operating under the alias “rose87168,” who is actively selling 6 million records exfiltrated from Oracle Cloud’s SSO and LDAP systems. The leaked data includes highly sensitive assets such as JKS files, encrypted SSO passwords, key files, and enterprise manager JPS keys, affecting over 140,000 tenants. The attacker, who has been active since January 2025, is demanding payment for data removal and even incentivizing assistance in decrypting the stolen credentials. Initial analysis suggests the breach may have originated from a vulnerable Oracle login subdomain , possibly linked to CVE-2021-35587—a critical flaw in Oracle Fusion Middleware’s Access Manager. The affected endpoint, last updated in 2014, underscores a lack of patch management and highlights broader concerns around supply chain vulnerabilities.

CVE-2025-27840,2025-04-16,reddit,"Hardware Can’t Be Trusted — So We Built Around It A recent vulnerability affecting the popular ESP32 microcontroller is exposing Bitcoin hardware wallets to key theft. The flaw includes: • Exploitable firmware/module updates • Weak RNG entropy → brute-forceable keypairs • Remote signature injection & transaction hijacking This isn’t just about one chip — it’s about a fundamental design flaw: If trust is rooted in hardware, the system is only as strong as its weakest microcontroller. What We Did Instead We’ve been working on an architecture that treats trust as behavior, not assumption. No reliance on global consensus or secure hardware. Instead: • Agents validate state locally • Trust scores are based on entropy quality, signature patterns, and behavior • Adaptive PoW rejects anomalies — even if signed • Entropy audits detect weak randomness in real time • Devices that act “out of spec” are automatically isolated or demoted If a key becomes guessable or spoofed, the system doesn’t alert — it acts. Big Picture: Cryptography isn’t just math. It’s entropy. It’s behavior. It’s architecture. The next evolution in blockchain security won't come from stronger chips. It’ll come from smarter systems that expect them to fail. Let me know if anyone’s working on similar agent-based or entropy-scoring models. Always curious to compare architectures."

Adam Khan, April 16, 2025 Today, the cybersecurity community faced a critical juncture as the U.S. government's contract with MITRE Corporation to develop, operate and modernize the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures program, as well as related efforts like CWE, was set to expire. MITRE warned of ""multiple impacts to CVE, including deterioration of national vulnerability databases and advisories, tool vendors, incident response operations, and all manner of critical infrastructure."" This development threatened the continuity of a foundational element in global cybersecurity infrastructure. In a last-minute intervention, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency extended funding and awarded an 11-month bridge contract to ensure there would be no lapse in CVE services. <URL> Understanding the CVE Program The CVE program, established in 1999 and managed by MITRE, provides a standardized system for identifying and cataloging publicly known cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Each vulnerability is assigned a unique identifier , facilitating consistent communication among security professionals, vendors and organizations worldwide. CVE records are categorized based on the type of vulnerability, affected software or hardware, and potential impact. These records typically include a brief description, references to public advisories or patches, and severity ratings, when available. The lifecycle of a CVE follows a structured process: 1. Discovery – A researcher, vendor or organization identifies a potential security flaw. 2. Submission – The issue is reported to a CVE Numbering Authority , which validates and assigns a CVE ID. 3. Disclosure – After validation, the vulnerability is publicly disclosed either by the discoverer or the CNA, depending on coordination. 4. Publication – The CVE entry is published to the CVE List and made available to the community for integration into tools and databases. 5. Ongoing Maintenance – MITRE and CNAs monitor for corrections, updates and additional reference material to keep the records accurate and useful. The CVE program serves as a backbone for security tools and frameworks such as the National Vulnerability Database , which augments CVE records with CVSS scores and metadata, and the Common Weakness Enumeration , which categorizes the underlying flaw types. By offering a centralized, transparent, and community-driven system, the CVE program supports timely vulnerability management and helps coordinate global response efforts. Importance of the CVE program The CVE program is foundational to global cybersecurity efforts for several reasons: Standardization: It offers a common language for describing vulnerabilities, enabling effective collaboration across different organizations and sectors.​ Integration: Many security tools and processes rely on CVE identifiers to function correctly, including vulnerability scanners, patch management systems and threat intelligence platforms. Coordination: The program supports coordinated vulnerability disclosure, allowing vendors and researchers to manage and communicate about security issues efficiently.​ Without the CVE system, the cybersecurity community would face challenges in tracking, prioritizing and mitigating vulnerabilities, leading to increased risks and potential exploitation by threat actors. Implications for the cybersecurity industry The potential lapse in CVE program funding raised several concerns:​ Operational disruption: A halt in CVE assignments could disrupt security vendors, security teams such as Incident responders and many others, as organizations would lack standardized identifiers for new vulnerabilities.​ Increased risk: Delayed vulnerability identification and remediation efforts could expose systems to prolonged periods of risk.​ Fragmentation: In the absence of a centralized system, disparate methods for tracking vulnerabilities might emerge, leading to inconsistencies and confusion.​ These challenges underscore the critical role of the CVE program in maintaining cybersecurity resilience across industries and national infrastructures. Strategic response and recommendations To ensure the sustainability and effectiveness of the CVE program, the following measures are recommended: 1. Diversify funding sources Engage stakeholders from the private sector, international partners and non-profit organizations to contribute to the program's funding, reducing reliance on a single government entity.​ 2. Establish independent governance The formation of the CVE Foundation aims to provide a neutral, community-driven governance structure, enhancing the program's resilience and global trust.​ 3. Enhance transparency Regular communication about the program's status, funding and strategic direction can build confidence among users and contributors.​ 4. Invest in automation Leveraging automation and artificial intelligence can improve the efficiency of vulnerability identification and management processes.​ 5. Strengthen international collaboration Foster partnerships with international cybersecurity organizations to ensure a unified approach to vulnerability management and to share best practices. European Union's proactive measures In response to the evolving cybersecurity landscape, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity has launched the European Vulnerability Database . This initiative embraces a multi-stakeholder approach by collecting publicly available vulnerability information from multiple sources, including Computer Security Incident Response Teams , vendors and existing databases. The EUVD aims to enhance transparency and efficiency in vulnerability management across the EU. Ensuring resilience and sustainability moving forward The recent funding crisis of the CVE program highlights the fragility of essential cybersecurity infrastructures. While immediate disruptions have been averted, it is imperative for the global cybersecurity community to take proactive steps to ensure the resilience and sustainability of vulnerability management systems. Collaborative efforts, diversified funding and international cooperation will be key to safeguarding our digital ecosystems.

A vulnerability in the Backstage permission plugin backend allows callers to extract some information about the conditional decisions returned by the permission policy installed in the permission backend. If the permission system is not in use or if the installed permission policy does not use conditional decisions, there is no impact. This issue has been patched in version 0.6.0 of the permissions backend. A workaround includes having administrators of the permission policies ensure that they are crafted in such a way that conditional decisions do not contain any sensitive information."

If the vulnerable code was part of some feature, them removing it would remove that feature. But the release notes made no mention of removed features. Which makes me suspect the code didn't do anything. But code that doesn't execute can't be exploited. My only guess: Something that was added during testing/debugging, then left in because of laziness/inertia."

CVE-2025-24054,2025-04-18,reddit,"Critical Flaw CVE-2025-24054 Active—NTLM Credentials at Risk A medium-severity flaw in Windows is under active attack, allowing attackers to steal NTLM credentials through minimal user interaction. Key Points: - CVE-2025-24054 exploits NTLM authentication protocol, allowing credential theft. - Active exploitation reported since March 19, targeting institutions in Poland and Romania. - Attackers use phishing campaigns to deliver malicious .library-ms files for NTLM hash extraction. The recently identified CVE-2025-24054 vulnerability in Microsoft Windows poses a significant risk by allowing unauthorized attackers to spoof NTLM credentials across networks. NTLM is an outdated authentication protocol that has been largely deprecated in favor of newer technologies like Kerberos. However, its continued presence in Windows environments presents an enduring target for cybercriminals. This flaw can be triggered with minimal user interaction, such as a simple click or file inspection, illustrating how effortless it is for attackers to exploit it. Once activated, it can lead to the extraction of NTLM hashes, which can be further leveraged in malicious campaigns to compromise systems. Following the initial reports of exploitation, cybersecurity firms identified numerous campaigns, particularly targeting government and private institutions in regions like Poland and Romania. Attackers have been observed distributing malicious links via emails, using trusted cloud storage platforms to evade detection. As these malicious .library-ms files take advantage of a ZIP archive format, they facilitate an SMB authentication request, enabling hash leaks with no direct execution of the files required. This seamless method of infiltration showcases the urgency for organizations to patch these vulnerabilities promptly and address the risks associated with NTLM to safeguard their networks against credential theft and further attacks.

CVE-2025-32434,2025-04-21,reddit,"Critical PyTorch Vulnerability Lets Attackers Run Malicious Code A serious vulnerability in PyTorch allows attackers to execute remote code, even when using previously recommended security measures. Key Points: - CVE-2025-32434 affects all PyTorch versions up to 2.5.1. - Vulnerability exists in the torch.load function with weightsonly=True parameter. - Remote code execution can happen without user interaction, posing significant risks. The recently identified CVE-2025-32434 vulnerability in PyTorch is alarming for developers and organizations relying on machine learning frameworks. Discovered by researcher Ji'an Zhou, this security flaw enables remote code execution when using the torch.load function with the weightsonly=True parameter—a combination formerly recommended as a safe option for loading models. This contradiction in guidance puts many users at risk, as the vulnerability allows attackers to craft malicious model files that can execute arbitrary code on victim systems, potentially leading to catastrophic security breaches. The impact of this vulnerability is particularly stark for machine learning pipelines that automatically download models from external sources or collaborative environments. With a CVSS score of 9.3, this critical vulnerability highlights how even established security measures can have unanticipated flaws. Users are urged to update to PyTorch version 2.6.0 or later to mitigate the risks or, as an interim measure, avoid using torch.load with weightsonly=True. The incident underscores the importance of maintaining up-to-date dependencies in any production environment dealing with sensitive data, reminding organizations that vulnerabilities can lurk even in features designed to enhance security. How can organizations better safeguard their machine learning pipelines against such vulnerabilities? Learn More: Cyber Security News Want to stay updated on the latest cyber threats?

CVE-2025-25364,2025-04-21,reddit,"Critical Speedify VPN Flaw Exposes macOS Users to Attacks A serious vulnerability in Speedify VPN for macOS allows local attackers to escalate privileges and gain control over systems. Key Points: - CVE-2025-25364 allows local privilege escalation on Speedify VPN for macOS. - The vulnerability is caused by improper input handling in the helper tool. - Exploiting the flaw can lead to arbitrary command execution as root. - Speedify VPN has released an update addressing this critical security issue. - Users must upgrade to version 15.4.1 or higher to ensure their systems are protected. The discovered vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-25364, is a significant security risk for users of Speedify VPN's macOS application. It resides in the me.connectify.SMJobBlessHelper helper tool, which executes system-level operations with root privileges. The security flaw arises from improper input validation in the XPC interface of this tool, allowing local attackers to inject malicious commands that the system would execute with root privileges. Specifically, the commands can be injected through two user-controlled fields in incoming XPC messages, cmdPath and cmdBin, which are not adequately sanitized. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to local privilege escalation, allowing attackers not only to execute arbitrary commands but also to read, modify, or delete critical system files, and potentially install persistent malware. Speedify has responded to the issue with an updated version that includes a complete rewrite of the flawed helper tool, eliminating the insecure handling of XPC messages and thereby closing this exploit vector. Users are strongly encouraged to update to the latest version to protect their devices from potential exploitation.

CVE-2025-30401,2025-04-23,reddit,WhatsApp for Windows flaw allowed remote code execution via spoofed files Meta recently patched a high-severity vulnerability in WhatsApp for Windows that allowed attackers to execute malicious code on a target’s machine by sending spoofed file types. The exploit didn’t require the user to do anything beyond opening what looked like a harmless file. This makes it particularly dangerous for less tech-savvy users and internal teams not trained in threat detection. What is known: \- Affected all WhatsApp for Windows versions prior to 2.2450.6 \- Exploited using specially crafted files with manipulated extensions \- Meta confirmed active exploitation before the patch was issued It’s a reminder that even popular desktop apps can become threat vectors when spoofing and user trust intersect. Were you or someone you know affected by this? Or have you seen this exploited in the wild in an org you work with?

CVE-2022-2390,2025-04-26,reddit,"Un jailbreak in arrivo sul firmware 11.x della console PlayStation 4 Best curtains shop in Dubai Un jailbreak in arrivo sul firmware 11.x della console PlayStation 4 <URL> recente exploit condiviso da zecoxao ha portato rapidamente ad una nuova vulnerabilità sulla gestione dei salvataggi di gioco per la console PlayStation 4, una tecnica già utilizzata in passato per violare altre console, come la PSP o la Wii.\ La vulnerabilità consente di eseguire codice non autorizzato, un primo passo fondamentale per aggirare le protezioni di sicurezza di Sony. Anche se per il momento non si tratta ancora di un jailbreak completo.\ Al momento, l’exploit permette di eseguire codice limitato sulla PlayStation 4, come script in Lua, un linguaggio di programmazione leggero.\ Questo potrebbe aprire la porta a funzionalità come l’esecuzione di homebrew o, potenzialmente, l’avvio di giochi PS2 tramite emulatori. Tuttavia, non è ancora chiaro se l’exploit sia in grado di supportare l’esecuzione di backup di giochi PS4 in modo stabile.\ Rispetto a exploit precedenti, questa vulnerabilità sembra promettente, ma non è priva di limitazioni. La tecnica basata sui salvataggi di gioco è stata utilizzata con successo su altre console, ma sulla PlayStation 4 non ha mai portato a un jailbreak completo.\ Intanto gli sviluppatori stanno lavorando per capire se questa scoperta possa evolversi in una soluzione più avanzata.\ A differenza di exploit precedenti, questa tecnica si basa su un errore di tipo double free nella funzione AIO del sistema operativo FreeBSD, che è alla base delle due console PlayStation 4 e PlayStation 5.\ La vulnerabilità, correlata al CVE-2022-2390, riguarda i firmware della console PlayStation 4 dalla versione 5.0 fino alla 12.02, mentre è stata corretta nel firmware 12.50.\ Per console PlayStation 5, l’exploit potrebbe funzionare fino alla versione 10.60, anche se non è ancora stato confermato con certezza se sia stato risolto nel firmware 11.0.\ Un utente anonimo ha condiviso successivamente alcuni dump del kernel che hanno confermato la correzione della vulnerabilità nei firmware più recenti.\ In seguito, il codice della patch è stato reso pubblico, e altri sviluppatori hanno confermato la validità della scoperta sui firmware precedenti.\ \ Stato attuale del jailbreak\ Sulla PlayStation 4, i metodi attualmente disponibili includono:\ \ \ Jailbreak 9.0, basato su exploit WebKit ed exFAT, richiede una chiavetta USB e funziona solo fino al firmware 9.0.\ Exploit PPPwn, rilasciato nel 2023, supporta firmware fino alla verisione 11.0 ma necessita di un dispositivo esterno per inviare il payload.\ \ Questa nuova vulnerabilità potrebbe consentire un jailbreak completamente eseguibile via browser fino al firmware 9.60, eliminando la necessità di dispositivi esterni.\ Per firmware superiori , potrebbe essere sfruttata tramite l’exploit Lua, che però richiede un raro gioco giapponese e un salvataggio modificato, rendendolo poco accessibile.\ Sulla PlayStation 5, la situazione appare più frammentata:\ \ \ L’exploit UMTX permette un jailbreak parziale fino al firmware 5.50 tramite browser, e fino al 7.61 utilizzando Blu-ray o Lua.\ Se confermata, la nuova vulnerabilità potrebbe estendere il jailbreak fino al firmware 10.60, potenzialmente abbinabile ad altri exploit kernel già noti . Tuttavia, l’assenza di un exploit hypervisor limita la possibilità di ottenere un jailbreak completo.\ \ Pare che la console PlayStation 4 possa beneficiare prima dei frutti di questa scoperta, grazie a una base più solida di exploit esistenti.\ Sulla PlayStation 5 invece, la mancanza di un exploit dell'hypervisor e le possibili misure anti-Kstuff nei firmware più recenti rappresentano ostacoli significativi.\ Fonte: x.comDiscover the best curtains shop in Dubai, where style meets quality and customization.

Prior to versions 2.2.13, 3.0.14, and 3.1.12, Rack::Static can serve files under the specified root: even if urls: are provided, which may expose other files under the specified root: unexpectedly. The vulnerability occurs because Rack::Static does not properly sanitize user-supplied paths before serving files. Specifically, encoded path traversal sequences are not correctly validated, allowing attackers to access files outside the designated static file directory. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can gain access to all files under the specified root: directory, provided they are able to determine then path of the file. Versions 2.2.13, 3.0.14, and 3.1.12 contain a patch for the issue.

CVE-2025-0282,2025-04-26,reddit,"Top 10 Trending CVEs Here’s a quick breakdown of the 10 most interesting vulnerabilities trending today: 1. CVE-2025-43865 - React Router is a router for React. In versions on the 7.0 branch prior to version 7.5.2, its possible to modify pre-rendered data by adding a header to the request. This allows to completely spoof its contents and modify all the values of the data object passed to the HTML.

Prior to versions 2.2.13, 3.0.14, and 3.1.12, Rack::Static can serve files under the specified root: even if urls: are provided, which may expose other files under the specified root: unexpectedly. The vulnerability occurs because Rack::Static does not properly sanitize user-supplied paths before serving files. Specifically, encoded path traversal sequences are not correctly validated, allowing attackers to access files outside the designated static file directory. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can gain access to all files under the specified root: directory, provided they are able to determine then path of the file. Versions 2.2.13, 3.0.14, and 3.1.12 contain a patch for the issue. Other mitigations include removing usage of Rack::Static, or ensuring that root: points at a directory path which only contains files which should be accessed publicly.

Prior to versions 2.2.13, 3.0.14, and 3.1.12, Rack::Static can serve files under the specified root: even if urls: are provided, which may expose other files under the specified root: unexpectedly. The vulnerability occurs because Rack::Static does not properly sanitize user-supplied paths before serving files. Specifically, encoded path traversal sequences are not correctly validated, allowing attackers to access files outside the designated static file directory. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can gain access to all files under the specified root: directory, provided they are able to determine then path of the file. Versions 2.2.13, 3.0.14, and 3.1.12 contain a patch for the issue. Other mitigations include removing usage of Rack::Static, or ensuring that root: points at a directory path which only contains files which should be accessed publicly.

Prior to versions 2.2.13, 3.0.14, and 3.1.12, Rack::Static can serve files under the specified root: even if urls: are provided, which may expose other files under the specified root: unexpectedly. The vulnerability occurs because Rack::Static does not properly sanitize user-supplied paths before serving files. Specifically, encoded path traversal sequences are not correctly validated, allowing attackers to access files outside the designated static file directory. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can gain access to all files under the specified root: directory, provided they are able to determine then path of the file. Versions 2.2.13, 3.0.14, and 3.1.12 contain a patch for the issue. Other mitigations include removing usage of Rack::Static, or ensuring that root: points at a directory path which only contains files which should be accessed publicly.

Prior to versions 2.2.13, 3.0.14, and 3.1.12, Rack::Static can serve files under the specified root: even if urls: are provided, which may expose other files under the specified root: unexpectedly. The vulnerability occurs because Rack::Static does not properly sanitize user-supplied paths before serving files. Specifically, encoded path traversal sequences are not correctly validated, allowing attackers to access files outside the designated static file directory. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can gain access to all files under the specified root: directory, provided they are able to determine then path of the file. Versions 2.2.13, 3.0.14, and 3.1.12 contain a patch for the issue. Other mitigations include removing usage of Rack::Static, or ensuring that root: points at a directory path which only contains files which should be accessed publicly.

CVE-2024-21762,2025-04-27,reddit,"FINAL FIREWALL MIGRATION PLAN Hello All, TLDR at the bottom. This is the first time I've undertaken a firewall migration project like this so to say I'm experiencing nervousness/imposter syndrome would be an understatement . so any encouragement, feedback or hard truths are greatly appreciated. That said, in preparation for a firewall migration I've been working on manually building this firewall config for a while now in Eve-NG and so far everything is working the way it should . I think I'm just about done wrapping it up as we're nearing our deployment date so I wanted to see if there were any holes in my plan . As you can see in the diagram we're migrating 3 Cisco ASAs to a single 400 series Fortigate . The main reason for the migration is to upgrade speeds from 2G to 10G and to modernize our equipment. After lots of research and thought I've decided to ditch the idea of VDOM/Virtual Interfaces and take the path of moving all of the interfaces from the ASAs to the Fortigate with the exception of the outside interfaces on the ""Guest"" and ""Ad Hoc"" firewalls . I'll also be using Central SNAT and rather than using IPSec as we did on the ASAs I'll be using SSL VPN due to time and my inability to get IPsec working right . So my configuration pretty much involves copying/consolidating the following configs from the Cisco ASAs over to the Fortigate: Interfaces: minus the two outside interfaces on the ""Guest"" and ""Ad Hoc"" firewalls Zones: each interface gets it's own zone Routing: each interface is a gateway except for two inside and one outside interface which are P2P and carry multiple subnets SNAT/DNAT Addresses/Groups, Services/Groups, IP Pools Firewall Policies: the only catch I had with this is the connection between the ""Ad Hoc"" firewall and the ""Corporate"" firewall as there were overlapping rules and the complication of ""Any"" rules. being that traffic to and from the ""Ad Hoc"" firewall basically has the potential to get filtered through 3 ACLs before getting out the door. VPN: SSL VPN with a cert from a trusted CA on the outside and a cert from a local CA on the inside for LDAPS The only changes I think I'll have to make on other network devices are moving the two 1Gb interface configs to a single 10Gb interface , rerouting public IPs pointed to the P2P outside interface of the ""Guest"" firewall to the main WAN interface and configuring the 10Gb interfaces on our core switch for the firewall interfaces. I'm preparing for the likelihood that issues will arise . TLDR: How bullet proof is my plan ? Given my situation how have you other network admins/engineers handled your first major project like this ? How conservative should I be with logging/features ? where would you recommend placing such features/logging ? What steps did you take during migration for deployment and assessment tests ? I know I'm probably overthinking this and I also understand that not only is there no such thing as a ""one size fits all"" method but there's also no such thing as a perfectly secure network. The way I've gone about this configuration is due to management giving me a deadline that I think I've finally pushed to it's limit. So I just need to get everything up and functioning to the best of my ability without introducing new vulnerabilities . FYI our environment isn't mission critical/can afford downtime, only exposes VPN as well as a small handful of servers to the internet and we only have maybe 750 - 1000 devices between staff and guests connected at any given time. Thanks and cheers!"

CVE-2022-24761,2025-04-22,telegram,"CVE-2022-24761 Description: Waitress is a Web Server Gateway Interface server for Python 2 and 3. When using Waitress versions 2.1.0 and prior behind a proxy that does not properly validate the incoming HTTP request matches the RFC7230 standard, Waitress and the frontend proxy may disagree on where one request starts and where it ends. This would allow requests to be smuggled via the front-end proxy to waitress and later behavior. There are two classes of vulnerability that may lead to request smuggling that are addressed by this advisory: The use of Python's `int` to parse strings into integers, leading to ` 10` to be parsed as `10`, or `0x01` to be parsed as `1`, where as the standard specifies that the string should contain only digits or hex digits; and Waitress does not support chunk extensions, however it was discarding them without validating that they did not contain illegal characters. This vulnerability has been patched in Waitress 2.1.1. A workaround is available. When deploying a proxy in front of waitress, turning on any and all functionality to make sure that the request matches the RFC7230 standard. Certain proxy servers may not have this functionality though and users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest version of waitress instead. Link:"

CVE-2022-24761,2025-04-22,telegram,"CVE-2022-24761 Description: Waitress is a Web Server Gateway Interface server for Python 2 and 3. When using Waitress versions 2.1.0 and prior behind a proxy that does not properly validate the incoming HTTP request matches the RFC7230 standard, Waitress and the frontend proxy may disagree on where one request starts and where it ends. This would allow requests to be smuggled via the front-end proxy to waitress and later behavior. There are two classes of vulnerability that may lead to request smuggling that are addressed by this advisory: The use of Python's `int` to parse strings into integers, leading to ` 10` to be parsed as `10`, or `0x01` to be parsed as `1`, where as the standard specifies that the string should contain only digits or hex digits; and Waitress does not support chunk extensions, however it was discarding them without validating that they did not contain illegal characters. This vulnerability has been patched in Waitress 2.1.1. A workaround is available. When deploying a proxy in front of waitress, turning on any and all functionality to make sure that the request matches the RFC7230 standard. Certain proxy servers may not have this functionality though and users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest version of waitress instead. Link:"

CVE-2025-24016,2025-04-22,telegram,"Wazuh Remote Code Execution - PoC Vulnerability Summary A critical RCE vulnerability has been identified in the Wazuh server due to unsafe deserialization in the wazuh-manager package. This bug affects Wazuh versions ≥ 4.4.0 and has been patched in version 4.9.1. Details The flaw lies in the Wazuh API's DistributedAPI, where user-controlled input is unsafely deserialized. This allows attackers with API access to execute arbitrary Python code on the master server using the runas endpoint. Proof of Concept ```POST /security/user/authenticate/runas HTTP/1.1 Host: target.com:55000 Authorization: Basic d2F6dXcta3dpTUltUzNjcjM3UDA1MHItOg== Content-Type: application/json { ""unhandledexc"": { ""class"": ""exit"", ""args"": } }``` The Authorization header is the base64 of `wazuh-wui:MyS3cr37P450r.-` . The payload causes the Wazuh server to shut down by calling Python's `exit` method. Impact Full Remote Code Execution via the API Server Shutdown in PoC Risk of lateral movement across Wazuh clusters Mitigation Upgrade to Wazuh v4.9.1 or higher Avoid exposing the API externally Monitor unusual API activity Stay sharp, hackers!

An attacker controlling the SMB share can intercept the NTLMv2 hash, crack it, or use it in pass-the-hash attacks. But how does an attacker deliver such a file to the victim? It turns out that just extracting a ZIP/RAR archive with the file is enough to trigger the exploit. No need to open the file. This is super effective for phishing. ( #Windows #FileExplorer"

When Windows File Explorer detects a .library-ms file in a folder, it automatically starts parsing it. If the file contains a link to a remote SMB share, an NTLM authentication handshake begins. An attacker controlling the SMB share can intercept the NTLMv2 hash, crack it, or use it in pass-the-hash attacks. But how does an attacker deliver such a file to the victim? It turns out that just extracting a ZIP/RAR archive with the file is enough to trigger the exploit. No need to open the file. This is super effective for phishing. ( #Windows #FileExplorer"

CVE-2024-0132,2025-04-22,telegram,"About Remote Code Execution - NVIDIA Container Toolkit vulnerability. NVIDIA's ( was released on September 25. The vulnerability ( by researchers from Wiz. ( containerized AI applications with access to GPU resources. AI is now almost impossible without the use of video cards. Therefore, this component is very common. The essence of the vulnerability is that a launched malicious container image can gain access to the host file system, which, in turn, can lead to the attacker's code execution, denial of service, escalation of privileges, information disclosure, and data tampering. If an attacker gains access to a desktop in this way, it’s not so bad, but what if he gains access to Kubernetes nodes or a cluster? AI service providers that launch untrusted images are at risk.

For EoP it can be Elephant, for Memory Corruption - Monkey, etc. Based on software names, we automatically select adjectives that begin with the same letters. ""Windows NAT"" -> ""Windy Nautical"". There can be many vulnerabilities of the same type in the same product. Therefore, we generate combinations of adverbs and past participles , and then map CVE identifiers into them. CVE-2024-38119 -> 202438119 -> ""2438119"": ""inquisitively underspecified"" Thus we get: ""Inquisitively Underspecified Windy Nautical Racoon"". ( #naming #fun"

An unpleasant novelty of this Tuesday was the availability of updates only for Windows 11, for many critical defects it is indicated that Windows 10 updates will be available “later”. In addition, Microsoft has given for many defects a critical evaluation, which differs from the CVSS3.1 rating. Probably more than in previous Tuesdays a correction was made on the probability of operation. As a result, only 11 defects received Critical, 2 - LOW, the rest - Important. 49 defects lead to an increase in privileges, 31 - to RCE, 17 - disclosure of information, 14 - refusal to maintain, 9 - bypassing security functions, 3 - spoofing. The Ransomexx is the next USE AFTER FREE in the CLFS driver and is used to increase the privileges to System. A defect (Ransomexx/Storm-2460 extortionists used, unfolding Pipemagic Backdor on the affected systems and increasing its privileges with this vulnerability. However, the company reports that it sees a few targeted attacks. We wrote about this VPO last year, we had the attacks with its use (the CLFS operation itself was in the attacks -(We found 5 similar vulnerabilities and reported them in Microsoft. Noteworthy vulnerabilities, although many look-looking defects in Redmond appreciated the operation as less likely due to the need to win in the race, the number of vulnerabilities affecting popular applications and services or not requiring interaction with the user. Non -asset attacking ( - Kerberos leakage bypassing Windows Defender Credential Guard. In addition to the use of patch, you need to update and ( - RCE in REMOTE Desktop Services, the attacking must connect to the system as the Remote Desktop gateway. ( - increasing privileges in Active Directory Certificate Services, an authenticated attacking can receive a domain admin. ( - RCE TCP / IP. The victim must send a request to the DHCPV6 connection to get a malicious package in response. ( - RCE in Excel, working through pre -viewing panel.

CVE-2025-24071 is associated with the file processing mechanism in Windows in Windows Explorer and the indexing system-they automatically analyze the file of `.Library-mass`, extracted during unpacking the malicious archive and containing a link to the SMB resource. The victim’s accounts can be used for the first time. The description and ROS of vulnerability (a 0x6rsS researcher on his blog. Experts also (that vulnerability can be used while maintaining a file with an expansion of `.Libry-mass` from an electronic letter. Despite the fact that the data about the vulnerability were published a couple of days ago, the attackers are not sleeping Attempts to operate CVE-2025-24071 in organizations in Russia and the Republic of Belarus. Attacks distribute archives that contain a document in PDF format and a file `.Library-mass`. The victim unpackens the archive and launches a PDF-Prime, while the file `.Library-mass` automatically and imperceptibly for the user sends data to the command center of attackers. PT ESC experts predict a surge in attacks using this vulnerability. We recommend the following protection methods: • limit the compounds for SMB protocol to external servers. • Update Windows to the latest version. • prohibit the launch of files with the extension of `.Library-mass`. • block the receipt of files with the extension of `.Library-mass` by e-mail.

CVE-2025-24071 is associated with the file processing mechanism in Windows in Windows Explorer and the indexing system-they automatically analyze the file of `.Library-mass`, extracted during unpacking the malicious archive and containing a link to the SMB resource. The victim’s accounts can be used for the first time. The description and ROS of vulnerability (a 0x6rsS researcher on his blog. Experts also (that vulnerability can be used while maintaining a file with an expansion of `.Libry-mass` from an electronic letter. Despite the fact that the data about the vulnerability were published a couple of days ago, the attackers are not sleeping Attempts to operate CVE-2025-24071 in organizations in Russia and the Republic of Belarus. Attacks distribute archives that contain a document in PDF format and a file `.Library-mass`. The victim unpackens the archive and launches a PDF-Prime, while the file `.Library-mass` automatically and imperceptibly for the user sends data to the command center of attackers. PT ESC experts predict a surge in attacks using this vulnerability. We recommend the following protection methods: • limit the compounds for SMB protocol to external servers. • Update Windows to the latest version. • prohibit the launch of files with the extension of `.Library-mass`. • block the receipt of files with the extension of `.Library-mass` by e-mail.
