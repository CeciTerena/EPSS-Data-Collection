CVE-2020-14979,2025-03-11,reddit,"Why does Defender hate Fan Control? An explanation of Windows Drivers, WinRing0.sys, and its 7.8 CVE score: #TL;DR Windows Defender is not wrong, per se. `WinRing0` DOES has a vulnerability that lets unprivileged programs hack into Windows. Fan Control is not malicious, WinRing0 is not malicious, but a malicious program can use WinRing0 to bypass your system's security measures because it has a vulnerability. Read source 1 for the technical details. You don't have to read this entire wall of text, skip to the headers that interests you. Introduction Hello everyone! As you probably found out by now, Fan Control's implementation is currently broken. This is due to the kernel driver that Fan Control uses WinRing0 being blocked by Windows Defender. I want to clarify a few things I learned while researching this and show a bit of behind the scenes of how your computer talks to Fan Control and why Defender has blocked it. Pet Peeve First off, as a computer scientist it pains me to see people's knee jerk reaction is to override their operating system's security systems. It's there to protect you, yes it can make mistakes, but you should generally wait for an official response or similar understanding and you shouldn't do it blindly. Your security means nothing if you override your security when it's inconvenient. It's kind of like taking the carbon monoxide alarm off the wall because you don't like that it's beeping super loudly. Anyways. What is a driver and why do we need them? ^ To answer why Defender has blocked fan Control, I first have to explain how Fan Control works with Windows. I'll try to keep this explanation as simple as possible. ^ Window's main job is to manage a bunch of different applications and allow them to talk to the hardware. In old times it used to be the case that a program can tell the computer to do whatever it wants. This was a problem because it could mess up other programs, crash the entire system, and do malicious things. So to fix this, operating systems now split up the computer's memory and give a piece to each application. This application now has its own space to do things, called user-space. Each application is only allowed to do things in its own piece of memory and nothing else. If the application crashed, the OS can throw away the application & its piece of memory and everything else on the system will be fine. This has a big problem though: applications isolated in user-space could not talk to hardware! If you can talk to the hardware, you can do anything to the system, so it's an intentional protection. But your hardware needs to talk to the operating system to work, but there is too many pieces of hardware that all work differently. Windows doesn't know how to talk to all of them! So we need these programs that can interface with hardware but can't live in user-space. But at the same time we want the kind of protection that user-space gives. The solution is drivers: special programs that can receive special exceptions to live in kernel-space. Kernel-space is the opposite of user-space. You can do anything in kernel-space! Like talk to hardware to control your fans or read your credit card number when you pay for something. Because kernel-space drivers are so high risk Microsoft gate keeps them with an iron fist, kinda like Apple's non-EU app store on iPhones. Fan Control used a driver called WinRing0 Fan Control cannot talk directly to your hardware. It can talk to a driver, and that driver can talk to the hardware. There are a few different drivers and api's Fan Control uses, but the main one was WinRing0. Who made WinRing0? WinRing0 is a third party driver developed by OpenLibSys. Who convinced Microsoft to let WinRing0 be a driver with privileges? The company called EVGA convinced Microsoft. Why? Because EVGA made software that used the third party driver. They don't use it anymore because it was vulnerable. WinRing0 is a vulnerable driver! This is why Defender hates WinRing0. On August 11th, 2020 a security researcher named Matt Hand publishedÂ¹ the vulnerability report for WinRing0 proving that it had a high-risk privilege escalation exploit. This means a user-space program can take control of this driver and then use it to gain kernel-space privileges. This means a lowly application can take advantage of WinRing0 to do whatever it wants to your computer! When this was discovered, EVGA abandoned WinRing0 and made their own proprietary driver that they use. The developers of WinRing0 can fix the driver, but under Microsoft's modern strict driver rules, an updated WinRing0 won't make it past Microsoft's driver gate keepers. Many projects used and still use this driver. That's why Microsoft couldn't just cut support outright for the driver- too many things would break all at once. But WinRing0 was on borrowed time, Microsoft planned to cut the driver in 2024, but then they pushed it back to Jan 2025. And now Microsoft seems to start following through. What are the risks of running a vulnerable driver? Well a vulnerable driver is basically a front door to your house that you cannot lock. If everyone in town is friendly, you're good. But all it takes is one malicious actor to recognize the vulnerable door and waltz right on in. The door still functions, and friendly programs like Fan Control are respectful when they have to go in your house through the door. But you are less protected while having it installed. I would recommend listening to Defender. If you choose to override Defender, know that your OS's front door is open, and any program you run can use it for whatever they wish.

CVE-2025-29927,2025-04-02,reddit,"Lessons from Next.js Middleware vulnerability CVE-2025-29927: Why Route-Level Auth Checks Are Worth the Extra Work Hey r/nextjs community, With the recent disclosure of CVE-2025-29927 , I wanted to share some thoughts on an authentication patterns that I always use in all my projects and that can help keep your apps secure, even in the face of framework-level vulnerabilities like this. For those who haven't heard, Vercel recently disclosed a critical vulnerability in Next.js middleware. By adding a special header to requests, attackers can completely bypass middleware-based authentication checks. This affects apps that rely on middleware for auth or security checks without additional validation at the route level. We can all agree that middleware-based auth is convenient , this vulnerability highlights why checking auth at the route level provides an additional layer of security. Yes, it's more verbose and requires more code, but it creates a defense-in-depth approach that's resilient to middleware bypasses. Here's a pattern I've been using, some people always ask why I don't just use the middleware, but that incident proves its effectiveness. First, create a requireAuth function: export async function requireAuth { const session = await auth; if { return redirect; } if ) { return { authorized: false, session }; } return { authorized: true, session }; } // Helper function to check roles function userHasRoles { const userRoles = user?.roles || ; const userRolesName = userRoles.map => role.role.name); return roles.every => userRolesName.includes); } Then, implement it in every route that needs protection: export default async function AdminPage { const { authorized } = await requireAuth; if return <Unauthorized />; // Your protected page content return ; } Benefits of This Approach 1. Resilience to middleware vulnerabilities: Even if middleware is bypassed, each route still performs its own auth check 2. Fine-grained control: Different routes can require different roles or permissions 3. Explicit security: Makes the security requirements of each route clear in the code 4. Early returns: Auth failures are handled before any sensitive logic executes I use Next.js Full-Stack-Kit for several projects and it implements this pattern consistently across all protected routes. What I like about that pattern is that auth checks aren't hidden away in some middleware config - they're right there at the top of each page component, making the security requirements explicit and reviewable. At first, It might seem tedious to add auth checks to every route , this vulnerability shows why that extra work is worth it. Defense in depth is a fundamental security principle, and implementing auth checks at multiple levels can save you from framework-level vulnerabilities. Stay safe guys!",0.847,9.1

Combine that with the admission controllerâs elevated privileges, and itâs game over. Affected Versions / Fix Fixed in: Ingress NGINX Controller versions 1.12.1 and 1.11.5. If youâre running an older release, youâre at risk. Patch ASAP. Mitigation Steps 1. Update to the latest Ingress NGINX Controller . 2. Lock down the admission webhook so itâs only reachable by the Kubernetes API Server. This means restricting network policies or ensuring the webhook isnât publicly exposed. 3. If you canât patch, you can: Temporarily disable the validating webhook by removing the ingress-nginx-admission ValidatingWebhookConfiguration and the --validating-webhook argument. Apply strict network policies so only the K8s control plane can talk to this webhook.",0.0036,8.8

We strongly recommend patching immediately to avoid affected versions 10.0.0 through 10.8.3 and 11.0.0 through 11.3.0. Successful exploitation of CVE-2025-31161 would give attackers admin level access across the CrushFTP application for further compromise. On 3 April 2025, Huntress observed in-the-wild exploitation of CVE-2025-31161, an authentication bypass vulnerability in versions of the CrushFTP software. We uncovered further post-exploitation activity leveraging the MeshCentral agent and other malware that we will discuss in this writeup. While doing some further analysis, we uncovered potential evidence of compromise as early as 30 March 2025, which seemed to be testing access, and did not spawn any external processes to CrushFTP. In a recent post from the ShadowServer team, they state as of March 30 there were \~1,500 vulnerable instances of CrushFTP publicly exposed to the internet. We have published a proof of concept, IOCs, and analysis on Mesh and AnyDesk post exploitations in this blog. What is CVE-2025-31161? CVE-2025-31161 is a 9.8 CVSS critical severity vulnerability that affects how the CrushFTP file transfer application handles user authentication. At the time of writing, the NIST NVD entry states the description: >CrushFTP versions 10.0.0 through 10.8.3 and 11.0.0 through 11.3.0 are affected by a vulnerability in the S3 authorization header processing that allows authentication bypass. Remote and unauthenticated HTTP requests to CrushFTP with known usernames can be used to impersonate a user and conduct actions on their behalf, including administrative actions and data retrieval. This vulnerability is patched and is mitigated in CrushFTP versions 11.3.1+ and 10.8.4+. Huntress has validated and confirmed the authentication bypass is prevented in patched versions. Please ensure your own installations of CrushFTP are updated to the latest versions. If your CrushFTP instance is publicly exposed to the open Internet, we strongly recommend you patch immediately. Upon successful exploitation, an adversary may gain access to the administrator user account for the CrushFTP application, and leverage this to create new backdoor accounts, access files , obtain code execution, and achieve full control of the vulnerable server. The vulnerability was assigned a CVE on March 26, and the Shadowserver Foundation first reported CVE-2025-31161 exploitation activity on March 31. The exploitation of CVE-2025-31161 is indicative of a concerning trend that weâve seen across several incidents, where threat actors are targeting MFT platforms as a way to deliver disruptive attacks. These platforms are typically external-facing and house sensitive enterprise data, making them a favorite for threat actors. As such, prompt patching is critical. Within our partner base we have seen 148 unique endpoints with the CrushFTP software installed as a service, with 95 of these running major versions 10 and 11. Approximately 72 different companies within our customer base were currently running unpatched versions of CrushFTP. Customers have been notified of the urgency to upgrade. Numerous other security firms have discussed CVE-2025-31161 and thanks to their shared insights, Huntress was able to recreate a proof-of-concept with ease. The core of this vulnerability is the S3 authentication functionality included as a part of CrushFTP. Due to logic bugs in the underlying source code , a mere Authorization header in an HTTP request is all that is needed to bypass authentication without valid username or password credentials. What is Huntress Doing? Post-exploitation efforts are already thoroughly covered by Huntress detection rules. In response to these intrusions specifically, we crafted detectors to find child processes invoked underneath the CrushFTP service executable. For community members not yet protected with Huntress, there are two Sigma rules available in the public SigmaHQ repository for: 1.
