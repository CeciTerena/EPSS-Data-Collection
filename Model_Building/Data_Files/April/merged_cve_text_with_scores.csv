CVE-2020-14979,2025-03-11,reddit,"Why does Defender hate Fan Control? An explanation of Windows Drivers, WinRing0.sys, and its 7.8 CVE score: #TL;DR Windows Defender is not wrong, per se. `WinRing0` DOES has a vulnerability that lets unprivileged programs hack into Windows. Fan Control is not malicious, WinRing0 is not malicious, but a malicious program can use WinRing0 to bypass your system's security measures because it has a vulnerability. Read source 1 for the technical details. You don't have to read this entire wall of text, skip to the headers that interests you. Introduction Hello everyone! As you probably found out by now, Fan Control's implementation is currently broken. This is due to the kernel driver that Fan Control uses WinRing0 being blocked by Windows Defender. I want to clarify a few things I learned while researching this and show a bit of behind the scenes of how your computer talks to Fan Control and why Defender has blocked it. Pet Peeve First off, as a computer scientist it pains me to see people's knee jerk reaction is to override their operating system's security systems. It's there to protect you, yes it can make mistakes, but you should generally wait for an official response or similar understanding and you shouldn't do it blindly. Your security means nothing if you override your security when it's inconvenient. It's kind of like taking the carbon monoxide alarm off the wall because you don't like that it's beeping super loudly. Anyways. What is a driver and why do we need them? ^ To answer why Defender has blocked fan Control, I first have to explain how Fan Control works with Windows. I'll try to keep this explanation as simple as possible. ^ Window's main job is to manage a bunch of different applications and allow them to talk to the hardware. In old times it used to be the case that a program can tell the computer to do whatever it wants. This was a problem because it could mess up other programs, crash the entire system, and do malicious things. So to fix this, operating systems now split up the computer's memory and give a piece to each application. This application now has its own space to do things, called user-space. Each application is only allowed to do things in its own piece of memory and nothing else. If the application crashed, the OS can throw away the application & its piece of memory and everything else on the system will be fine. This has a big problem though: applications isolated in user-space could not talk to hardware! If you can talk to the hardware, you can do anything to the system, so it's an intentional protection. But your hardware needs to talk to the operating system to work, but there is too many pieces of hardware that all work differently. Windows doesn't know how to talk to all of them! So we need these programs that can interface with hardware but can't live in user-space. But at the same time we want the kind of protection that user-space gives. The solution is drivers: special programs that can receive special exceptions to live in kernel-space. Kernel-space is the opposite of user-space. You can do anything in kernel-space! Like talk to hardware to control your fans or read your credit card number when you pay for something. Because kernel-space drivers are so high risk Microsoft gate keeps them with an iron fist, kinda like Apple's non-EU app store on iPhones. Fan Control used a driver called WinRing0 Fan Control cannot talk directly to your hardware. It can talk to a driver, and that driver can talk to the hardware. There are a few different drivers and api's Fan Control uses, but the main one was WinRing0. Who made WinRing0? WinRing0 is a third party driver developed by OpenLibSys. Who convinced Microsoft to let WinRing0 be a driver with privileges? The company called EVGA convinced Microsoft. Why? Because EVGA made software that used the third party driver. They don't use it anymore because it was vulnerable. WinRing0 is a vulnerable driver! This is why Defender hates WinRing0. On August 11th, 2020 a security researcher named Matt Hand published¹ the vulnerability report for WinRing0 proving that it had a high-risk privilege escalation exploit. This means a user-space program can take control of this driver and then use it to gain kernel-space privileges. This means a lowly application can take advantage of WinRing0 to do whatever it wants to your computer! When this was discovered, EVGA abandoned WinRing0 and made their own proprietary driver that they use. The developers of WinRing0 can fix the driver, but under Microsoft's modern strict driver rules, an updated WinRing0 won't make it past Microsoft's driver gate keepers. Many projects used and still use this driver. That's why Microsoft couldn't just cut support outright for the driver- too many things would break all at once. But WinRing0 was on borrowed time, Microsoft planned to cut the driver in 2024, but then they pushed it back to Jan 2025. And now Microsoft seems to start following through. What are the risks of running a vulnerable driver? Well a vulnerable driver is basically a front door to your house that you cannot lock. If everyone in town is friendly, you're good. But all it takes is one malicious actor to recognize the vulnerable door and waltz right on in. The door still functions, and friendly programs like Fan Control are respectful when they have to go in your house through the door. But you are less protected while having it installed. I would recommend listening to Defender. If you choose to override Defender, know that your OS's front door is open, and any program you run can use it for whatever they wish.

CVE-2025-29927,2025-04-02,reddit,"Lessons from Next.js Middleware vulnerability CVE-2025-29927: Why Route-Level Auth Checks Are Worth the Extra Work Hey r/nextjs community, With the recent disclosure of CVE-2025-29927 , I wanted to share some thoughts on an authentication patterns that I always use in all my projects and that can help keep your apps secure, even in the face of framework-level vulnerabilities like this. For those who haven't heard, Vercel recently disclosed a critical vulnerability in Next.js middleware. By adding a special header to requests, attackers can completely bypass middleware-based authentication checks. This affects apps that rely on middleware for auth or security checks without additional validation at the route level. We can all agree that middleware-based auth is convenient , this vulnerability highlights why checking auth at the route level provides an additional layer of security. Yes, it's more verbose and requires more code, but it creates a defense-in-depth approach that's resilient to middleware bypasses. Here's a pattern I've been using, some people always ask why I don't just use the middleware, but that incident proves its effectiveness. First, create a requireAuth function: export async function requireAuth { const session = await auth; if { return redirect; } if ) { return { authorized: false, session }; } return { authorized: true, session }; } // Helper function to check roles function userHasRoles { const userRoles = user?.roles || ; const userRolesName = userRoles.map => role.role.name); return roles.every => userRolesName.includes); } Then, implement it in every route that needs protection: export default async function AdminPage { const { authorized } = await requireAuth; if return <Unauthorized />; // Your protected page content return ; } Benefits of This Approach 1. Resilience to middleware vulnerabilities: Even if middleware is bypassed, each route still performs its own auth check 2. Fine-grained control: Different routes can require different roles or permissions 3. Explicit security: Makes the security requirements of each route clear in the code 4. Early returns: Auth failures are handled before any sensitive logic executes I use Next.js Full-Stack-Kit for several projects and it implements this pattern consistently across all protected routes. What I like about that pattern is that auth checks aren't hidden away in some middleware config - they're right there at the top of each page component, making the security requirements explicit and reviewable. At first, It might seem tedious to add auth checks to every route , this vulnerability shows why that extra work is worth it. Defense in depth is a fundamental security principle, and implementing auth checks at multiple levels can save you from framework-level vulnerabilities.

CVE-2025-23120,2025-03-21,reddit,"Veeam CVE 9.9 Alert - // Overview On March 19th, 2025, software vendor Veeam announced a patch to address CVE-2025-23120, which allows for remote code execution by any domain authenticated users. The CVSS score is 9.9 representing a serious risk, however this impacts only AD Domain-joined backup servers. The attack takes advantage of a deserialization vulnerability in two different .NET classes. Deserialization is a process to reassemble data after it has been broken into smaller pieces in a stream of bytes known as serialization. The vendor, watchTowr, who reported the vulnerability to Veeam, made note to mention the process of relying on deny-lists, instead of accept-lists is one of the root causes, as it allows attackers to attempt to identify other classes which are not blocked to facilitate code execution. As Sophos has previously reported\, Veeam backup servers are frequently targeted by financially motivated threat actors to encrypt and ransom an organization’s data. We recommend high priority be given to patching your backup servers if they meet the criteria below. In addition, Sophos does support Veeam integration to further strengthen your protections\. // What you should do Customers running Veeam Backup & Replication software products are advised to upgrade to version 12.3.1, or apply the latest hotfix 12.3 following the vendor’s specific guidance: 1. 12.3.0.310 and all earlier builds of version 12 are impacted Please be advised that application of this hotfix may overwrite previous hotfixes per Veeam’s guidance. <URL> Additional Reporting 1. <URL> 2. \ <URL>",0.00254,8.8,A vulnerability allowing remote code execution (RCE) for domain users.,3.1,8.8,NETWORK,LOW,LOW,NONE,UNCHANGED,HIGH,HIGH,HIGH

HTTP/1.1 data streams are not impacted.

In normal conditions, decrypted packet captures are available to firewall administrators after they obtain and install a free Decryption Port Mirror license. The license requirement ensures that this feature can only be used after approved personnel purposefully activate the license. For more information, review how to  configure decryption port mirroring https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/decryption/administration/monitoring-decryption/configure-decryption-port-mirroring .

The administrator must obtain network access to the management interface (web, SSH, console, or telnet) and successfully authenticate to exploit this issue. Risk of this issue can be greatly reduced by restricting access to the management interface to only trusted administrators and from only internal IP addresses according to our recommended  critical deployment guidelines https://live.paloaltonetworks.com/t5/community-blogs/tips-amp-tricks-how-to-secure-the-management-access-of-your-palo/ba-p/464431 .

CVE-2025-2825,2025-04-04,reddit,"Critical Vulnerability: CrushFTP CVE-2025-31161 Auth Bypass and Post-Exploitation TL;DR: CVE-2025-31161 is a critical severity vulnerability allowing attackers to control how user authentication is handled by CrushFTP managed file transfer software. We strongly recommend patching immediately to avoid affected versions 10.0.0 through 10.8.3 and 11.0.0 through 11.3.0. Successful exploitation of CVE-2025-31161 would give attackers admin level access across the CrushFTP application for further compromise. On 3 April 2025, Huntress observed in-the-wild exploitation of CVE-2025-31161, an authentication bypass vulnerability in versions of the CrushFTP software. We uncovered further post-exploitation activity leveraging the MeshCentral agent and other malware that we will discuss in this writeup. While doing some further analysis, we uncovered potential evidence of compromise as early as 30 March 2025, which seemed to be testing access, and did not spawn any external processes to CrushFTP. In a recent post from the ShadowServer team, they state as of March 30 there were \~1,500 vulnerable instances of CrushFTP publicly exposed to the internet. We have published a proof of concept, IOCs, and analysis on Mesh and AnyDesk post exploitations in this blog. What is CVE-2025-31161? CVE-2025-31161 is a 9.8 CVSS critical severity vulnerability that affects how the CrushFTP file transfer application handles user authentication. At the time of writing, the NIST NVD entry states the description: >CrushFTP versions 10.0.0 through 10.8.3 and 11.0.0 through 11.3.0 are affected by a vulnerability in the S3 authorization header processing that allows authentication bypass. Remote and unauthenticated HTTP requests to CrushFTP with known usernames can be used to impersonate a user and conduct actions on their behalf, including administrative actions and data retrieval. This vulnerability is patched and is mitigated in CrushFTP versions 11.3.1+ and 10.8.4+. Huntress has validated and confirmed the authentication bypass is prevented in patched versions. Please ensure your own installations of CrushFTP are updated to the latest versions. If your CrushFTP instance is publicly exposed to the open Internet, we strongly recommend you patch immediately. Upon successful exploitation, an adversary may gain access to the administrator user account for the CrushFTP application, and leverage this to create new backdoor accounts, access files , obtain code execution, and achieve full control of the vulnerable server. The vulnerability was assigned a CVE on March 26, and the Shadowserver Foundation first reported CVE-2025-31161 exploitation activity on March 31. The exploitation of CVE-2025-31161 is indicative of a concerning trend that we’ve seen across several incidents, where threat actors are targeting MFT platforms as a way to deliver disruptive attacks. These platforms are typically external-facing and house sensitive enterprise data, making them a favorite for threat actors. As such, prompt patching is critical. Within our partner base we have seen 148 unique endpoints with the CrushFTP software installed as a service, with 95 of these running major versions 10 and 11. Approximately 72 different companies within our customer base were currently running unpatched versions of CrushFTP. Customers have been notified of the urgency to upgrade. Numerous other security firms have discussed CVE-2025-31161 and thanks to their shared insights, Huntress was able to recreate a proof-of-concept with ease. The core of this vulnerability is the S3 authentication functionality included as a part of CrushFTP. Due to logic bugs in the underlying source code , a mere Authorization header in an HTTP request is all that is needed to bypass authentication without valid username or password credentials. What is Huntress Doing? Post-exploitation efforts are already thoroughly covered by Huntress detection rules. In response to these intrusions specifically, we crafted detectors to find child processes invoked underneath the CrushFTP service executable. For community members not yet protected with Huntress, there are two Sigma rules available in the public SigmaHQ repository for: 1.

CVE-2025-31161,2025-04-04,reddit,"Critical Vulnerability: CrushFTP CVE-2025-31161 Auth Bypass and Post-Exploitation TL;DR: CVE-2025-31161 is a critical severity vulnerability allowing attackers to control how user authentication is handled by CrushFTP managed file transfer software. We strongly recommend patching immediately to avoid affected versions 10.0.0 through 10.8.3 and 11.0.0 through 11.3.0. Successful exploitation of CVE-2025-31161 would give attackers admin level access across the CrushFTP application for further compromise. On 3 April 2025, Huntress observed in-the-wild exploitation of CVE-2025-31161, an authentication bypass vulnerability in versions of the CrushFTP software. We uncovered further post-exploitation activity leveraging the MeshCentral agent and other malware that we will discuss in this writeup. While doing some further analysis, we uncovered potential evidence of compromise as early as 30 March 2025, which seemed to be testing access, and did not spawn any external processes to CrushFTP. In a recent post from the ShadowServer team, they state as of March 30 there were \~1,500 vulnerable instances of CrushFTP publicly exposed to the internet. We have published a proof of concept, IOCs, and analysis on Mesh and AnyDesk post exploitations in this blog. What is CVE-2025-31161? CVE-2025-31161 is a 9.8 CVSS critical severity vulnerability that affects how the CrushFTP file transfer application handles user authentication. At the time of writing, the NIST NVD entry states the description: >CrushFTP versions 10.0.0 through 10.8.3 and 11.0.0 through 11.3.0 are affected by a vulnerability in the S3 authorization header processing that allows authentication bypass. Remote and unauthenticated HTTP requests to CrushFTP with known usernames can be used to impersonate a user and conduct actions on their behalf, including administrative actions and data retrieval. This vulnerability is patched and is mitigated in CrushFTP versions 11.3.1+ and 10.8.4+. Huntress has validated and confirmed the authentication bypass is prevented in patched versions. Please ensure your own installations of CrushFTP are updated to the latest versions. If your CrushFTP instance is publicly exposed to the open Internet, we strongly recommend you patch immediately. Upon successful exploitation, an adversary may gain access to the administrator user account for the CrushFTP application, and leverage this to create new backdoor accounts, access files , obtain code execution, and achieve full control of the vulnerable server. The vulnerability was assigned a CVE on March 26, and the Shadowserver Foundation first reported CVE-2025-31161 exploitation activity on March 31. The exploitation of CVE-2025-31161 is indicative of a concerning trend that we’ve seen across several incidents, where threat actors are targeting MFT platforms as a way to deliver disruptive attacks. These platforms are typically external-facing and house sensitive enterprise data, making them a favorite for threat actors. As such, prompt patching is critical. Within our partner base we have seen 148 unique endpoints with the CrushFTP software installed as a service, with 95 of these running major versions 10 and 11. Approximately 72 different companies within our customer base were currently running unpatched versions of CrushFTP. Customers have been notified of the urgency to upgrade. Numerous other security firms have discussed CVE-2025-31161 and thanks to their shared insights, Huntress was able to recreate a proof-of-concept with ease. The core of this vulnerability is the S3 authentication functionality included as a part of CrushFTP. Due to logic bugs in the underlying source code , a mere Authorization header in an HTTP request is all that is needed to bypass authentication without valid username or password credentials. What is Huntress Doing? Post-exploitation efforts are already thoroughly covered by Huntress detection rules. In response to these intrusions specifically, we crafted detectors to find child processes invoked underneath the CrushFTP service executable. For community members not yet protected with Huntress, there are two Sigma rules available in the public SigmaHQ repository for: 1.

A race condition exists in the AWS4-HMAC (compatible with S3) authorization method of the HTTP component of the FTP server. The server first verifies the existence of the user by performing a call to login_user_pass() with no password requirement. This will authenticate the session through the HMAC verification process and up until the server checks for user verification once more. The vulnerability can be further stabilized, eliminating the need for successfully triggering a race condition, by sending a mangled AWS4-HMAC header. By providing only the username and a following slash (/), the server will successfully find a username, which triggers the successful anypass authentication process, but the server will fail to find the expected SignedHeaders entry, resulting in an index-out-of-bounds error that stops the code from reaching the session cleanup. Together, these issues make it trivial to authenticate as any known or guessable user (e.g., crushadmin), and can lead to a full compromise of the system by obtaining an administrative account.",3.1,9.8,NETWORK,LOW,NONE,NONE,UNCHANGED,HIGH,HIGH,HIGH

This issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.2, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.34, from 9.0.0.M1 through 9.0.98.

If all of the following were true, a malicious user was able to view       security sensitive files and/or inject content into those files:
- writes enabled for the default servlet (disabled by default)
- support for partial PUT (enabled by default)
- a target URL for security sensitive uploads that was a sub-directory of a target URL for public uploads
- attacker knowledge of the names of security sensitive files being uploaded
- the security sensitive files also being uploaded via partial PUT

If all of the following were true, a malicious user was able to       perform remote code execution:
- writes enabled for the default servlet (disabled by default)
- support for partial PUT (enabled by default)
- application was using Tomcat's file based session persistence with the default storage location
- application included a library that may be leveraged in a deserialization attack

Best regards to everyone, and thank you for your support!",0.58568,5.9,"The SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC).

CVE-2024-0132,2025-04-15,reddit,"Nvidia Patch Incompleteness Poses Risks in AI Container Security Trend Micro has discovered a critical security flaw in Nvidia's patch for the Container Toolkit that still leaves AI environments vulnerable to attacks. Key Points: - Trend Micro flags Nvidia's incomplete patch for a critical vulnerability. - The flaw allows potential container escape attacks and unauthorized access. - Organizations using Nvidia's toolkit are directly at risk, especially with default settings. - The patch doesn't properly enforce checks against race conditions, allowing exploitation. - A denial-of-service flaw has also been identified affecting Docker on Linux systems. Trend Micro researchers have flagged significant issues with Nvidia's patching of a critical vulnerability found in the Nvidia Container Toolkit, originally addressed last September. The vulnerability, identified as CVE-2024-0132, scored an alarming 9 out of 10 on the CVSS scale, categorizing it as high priority. However, Trend Micro's findings indicate that the patch is not fully effective, leaving enterprises exposed to dangerous container escape attacks. Such vulnerabilities enable hackers to execute arbitrary commands and access sensitive data, putting organizations' proprietary information at significant risk. The security gap lies in the incomplete enforcement of checks that would typically prevent exploitation via the time-of-check to time-of-use race condition. This flaw allows a crafted container to maneuver past isolation barriers and manipulate host resources. The potential fallout from such exploitation includes theft of sensitive information, prolonged system downtime, and substantial operational disruptions. Organizations relying on the Nvidia Container Toolkit for their AI workloads and Docker environments must be aware of these risks, particularly those operating with default configurations or the newer features of the toolkit. Additionally, alongside this vulnerability, Trend Micro has pointed out a related denial-of-service issue specifically affecting Docker configurations on Linux systems. Containers using specific mount options can lead to unchecked growth in the Linux mount table, creating a service disruption that can hinder remote access and overall operation. To mitigate these threats, Trend Micro advocates for stricter access controls and the disabling of unnecessary features within the Nvidia toolkit.

Key Points: - The inetpub folder is created as part of a security update to mitigate a significant vulnerability. - Users should not delete the inetpub folder despite its empty appearance. - The folder enhances protection against privilege escalation exploits on Windows systems. Windows 10 and 11 users have recently noticed a seemingly empty directory called 'inetpub' appearing on their systems after installing Microsoft's April 2025 Patch Tuesday updates. While many users may see this folder as unnecessary and consider deleting it, Microsoft has explicitly warned against such action, clarifying that it plays a critical role in protecting systems from exploitation of a newly patched vulnerability, CVE-2025-21204. This vulnerability poses a serious risk as it allows unauthorized users to potentially gain system-level access, posing a significant threat to the integrity of a user's system. The inetpub folder is typically associated with Microsoft's Internet Information Services web server software. However, even users without IIS installed are affected by this change. The folder is created with specific read-only SYSTEM-level permissions, which enhances security measures against potential privilege escalation attempts. Microsoft reassures users that there is currently no evidence of active exploitation regarding CVE-2025-21204, but maintaining the folder's integrity is key to preventing future security risks.

CVE-2021-35587,2025-04-16,reddit,"Massive Oracle Cloud Breach: Threat Actor Sells 6M Records Exploited via Critical Vulnerability On March 21, 2025, CloudSEK’s XVigil uncovered a high-severity security breach involving a threat actor operating under the alias “rose87168,” who is actively selling 6 million records exfiltrated from Oracle Cloud’s SSO and LDAP systems. The leaked data includes highly sensitive assets such as JKS files, encrypted SSO passwords, key files, and enterprise manager JPS keys, affecting over 140,000 tenants. The attacker, who has been active since January 2025, is demanding payment for data removal and even incentivizing assistance in decrypting the stolen credentials. Initial analysis suggests the breach may have originated from a vulnerable Oracle login subdomain , possibly linked to CVE-2021-35587—a critical flaw in Oracle Fusion Middleware’s Access Manager. The affected endpoint, last updated in 2014, underscores a lack of patch management and highlights broader concerns around supply chain vulnerabilities. Though the threat actor is new with no prior history, the sophistication of the attack, combined with extortion tactics and a potentially exploited zero-day.

CVE-2025-27840,2025-04-16,reddit,"Hardware Can’t Be Trusted — So We Built Around It A recent vulnerability affecting the popular ESP32 microcontroller is exposing Bitcoin hardware wallets to key theft. The flaw includes: • Exploitable firmware/module updates • Weak RNG entropy → brute-forceable keypairs • Remote signature injection & transaction hijacking This isn’t just about one chip — it’s about a fundamental design flaw: If trust is rooted in hardware, the system is only as strong as its weakest microcontroller. What We Did Instead We’ve been working on an architecture that treats trust as behavior, not assumption. No reliance on global consensus or secure hardware. Instead: • Agents validate state locally • Trust scores are based on entropy quality, signature patterns, and behavior • Adaptive PoW rejects anomalies — even if signed • Entropy audits detect weak randomness in real time • Devices that act “out of spec” are automatically isolated or demoted If a key becomes guessable or spoofed, the system doesn’t alert — it acts.

CVE-2025-12345,2025-04-16,reddit,"CVE program's funding crisis: Implications and strategic response Today, the cybersecurity community faced a critical juncture as the U.S. government's contract with MITRE Corporation to develop, operate and modernize the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures program, as well as related efforts like CWE, was set to expire. Adam Khan, April 16, 2025 Today, the cybersecurity community faced a critical juncture as the U.S. government's contract with MITRE Corporation to develop, operate and modernize the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures program, as well as related efforts like CWE, was set to expire. MITRE warned of ""multiple impacts to CVE, including deterioration of national vulnerability databases and advisories, tool vendors, incident response operations, and all manner of critical infrastructure."" This development threatened the continuity of a foundational element in global cybersecurity infrastructure. In a last-minute intervention, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency extended funding and awarded an 11-month bridge contract to ensure there would be no lapse in CVE services. <URL> Understanding the CVE Program The CVE program, established in 1999 and managed by MITRE, provides a standardized system for identifying and cataloging publicly known cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Each vulnerability is assigned a unique identifier , facilitating consistent communication among security professionals, vendors and organizations worldwide. CVE records are categorized based on the type of vulnerability, affected software or hardware, and potential impact. These records typically include a brief description, references to public advisories or patches, and severity ratings, when available. The lifecycle of a CVE follows a structured process: 1. Discovery – A researcher, vendor or organization identifies a potential security flaw. 2. Submission – The issue is reported to a CVE Numbering Authority , which validates and assigns a CVE ID. 3. Disclosure – After validation, the vulnerability is publicly disclosed either by the discoverer or the CNA, depending on coordination. 4. Publication – The CVE entry is published to the CVE List and made available to the community for integration into tools and databases. 5. Ongoing Maintenance – MITRE and CNAs monitor for corrections, updates and additional reference material to keep the records accurate and useful. The CVE program serves as a backbone for security tools and frameworks such as the National Vulnerability Database , which augments CVE records with CVSS scores and metadata, and the Common Weakness Enumeration , which categorizes the underlying flaw types. By offering a centralized, transparent, and community-driven system, the CVE program supports timely vulnerability management and helps coordinate global response efforts. Importance of the CVE program The CVE program is foundational to global cybersecurity efforts for several reasons: Standardization: It offers a common language for describing vulnerabilities, enabling effective collaboration across different organizations and sectors.​ Integration: Many security tools and processes rely on CVE identifiers to function correctly, including vulnerability scanners, patch management systems and threat intelligence platforms. Coordination: The program supports coordinated vulnerability disclosure, allowing vendors and researchers to manage and communicate about security issues efficiently.​ Without the CVE system, the cybersecurity community would face challenges in tracking, prioritizing and mitigating vulnerabilities, leading to increased risks and potential exploitation by threat actors. Implications for the cybersecurity industry The potential lapse in CVE program funding raised several concerns:​ Operational disruption: A halt in CVE assignments could disrupt security vendors, security teams such as Incident responders and many others, as organizations would lack standardized identifiers for new vulnerabilities.​ Increased risk: Delayed vulnerability identification and remediation efforts could expose systems to prolonged periods of risk.​ Fragmentation: In the absence of a centralized system, disparate methods for tracking vulnerabilities might emerge, leading to inconsistencies and confusion.​ These challenges underscore the critical role of the CVE program in maintaining cybersecurity resilience across industries and national infrastructures. Strategic response and recommendations To ensure the sustainability and effectiveness of the CVE program, the following measures are recommended: 1. Diversify funding sources Engage stakeholders from the private sector, international partners and non-profit organizations to contribute to the program's funding, reducing reliance on a single government entity.​ 2. Establish independent governance The formation of the CVE Foundation aims to provide a neutral, community-driven governance structure, enhancing the program's resilience and global trust.​ 3. Enhance transparency Regular communication about the program's status, funding and strategic direction can build confidence among users and contributors.​ 4. Invest in automation Leveraging automation and artificial intelligence can improve the efficiency of vulnerability identification and management processes.​ 5. Strengthen international collaboration Foster partnerships with international cybersecurity organizations to ensure a unified approach to vulnerability management and to share best practices. European Union's proactive measures In response to the evolving cybersecurity landscape, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity has launched the European Vulnerability Database . This initiative embraces a multi-stakeholder approach by collecting publicly available vulnerability information from multiple sources, including Computer Security Incident Response Teams , vendors and existing databases. The EUVD aims to enhance transparency and efficiency in vulnerability management across the EU. Ensuring resilience and sustainability moving forward The recent funding crisis of the CVE program highlights the fragility of essential cybersecurity infrastructures. While immediate disruptions have been averted, it is imperative for the global cybersecurity community to take proactive steps to ensure the resilience and sustainability of vulnerability management systems. Collaborative efforts, diversified funding and international cooperation will be key to safeguarding our digital ecosystems.

CVE-2025-24054,2025-04-18,reddit,"Critical Flaw CVE-2025-24054 Active—NTLM Credentials at Risk A medium-severity flaw in Windows is under active attack, allowing attackers to steal NTLM credentials through minimal user interaction. Key Points: - CVE-2025-24054 exploits NTLM authentication protocol, allowing credential theft. - Active exploitation reported since March 19, targeting institutions in Poland and Romania. - Attackers use phishing campaigns to deliver malicious .library-ms files for NTLM hash extraction. The recently identified CVE-2025-24054 vulnerability in Microsoft Windows poses a significant risk by allowing unauthorized attackers to spoof NTLM credentials across networks. NTLM is an outdated authentication protocol that has been largely deprecated in favor of newer technologies like Kerberos. However, its continued presence in Windows environments presents an enduring target for cybercriminals. This flaw can be triggered with minimal user interaction, such as a simple click or file inspection, illustrating how effortless it is for attackers to exploit it. Once activated, it can lead to the extraction of NTLM hashes, which can be further leveraged in malicious campaigns to compromise systems. Following the initial reports of exploitation, cybersecurity firms identified numerous campaigns, particularly targeting government and private institutions in regions like Poland and Romania. Attackers have been observed distributing malicious links via emails, using trusted cloud storage platforms to evade detection. As these malicious .library-ms files take advantage of a ZIP archive format, they facilitate an SMB authentication request, enabling hash leaks with no direct execution of the files required. This seamless method of infiltration showcases the urgency for organizations to patch these vulnerabilities promptly and address the risks associated with NTLM to safeguard their networks against credential theft and further attacks.

CVE-2025-32434,2025-04-21,reddit,"Critical PyTorch Vulnerability Lets Attackers Run Malicious Code A serious vulnerability in PyTorch allows attackers to execute remote code, even when using previously recommended security measures. Key Points: - CVE-2025-32434 affects all PyTorch versions up to 2.5.1. - Vulnerability exists in the torch.load function with weightsonly=True parameter. - Remote code execution can happen without user interaction, posing significant risks. The recently identified CVE-2025-32434 vulnerability in PyTorch is alarming for developers and organizations relying on machine learning frameworks. Discovered by researcher Ji'an Zhou, this security flaw enables remote code execution when using the torch.load function with the weightsonly=True parameter—a combination formerly recommended as a safe option for loading models. This contradiction in guidance puts many users at risk, as the vulnerability allows attackers to craft malicious model files that can execute arbitrary code on victim systems, potentially leading to catastrophic security breaches. The impact of this vulnerability is particularly stark for machine learning pipelines that automatically download models from external sources or collaborative environments. With a CVSS score of 9.3, this critical vulnerability highlights how even established security measures can have unanticipated flaws. Users are urged to update to PyTorch version 2.6.0 or later to mitigate the risks or, as an interim measure, avoid using torch.load with weightsonly=True. The incident underscores the importance of maintaining up-to-date dependencies in any production environment dealing with sensitive data, reminding organizations that vulnerabilities can lurk even in features designed to enhance security.

CVE-2025-25364,2025-04-21,reddit,"Critical Speedify VPN Flaw Exposes macOS Users to Attacks A serious vulnerability in Speedify VPN for macOS allows local attackers to escalate privileges and gain control over systems. Key Points: - CVE-2025-25364 allows local privilege escalation on Speedify VPN for macOS. - The vulnerability is caused by improper input handling in the helper tool. - Exploiting the flaw can lead to arbitrary command execution as root. - Speedify VPN has released an update addressing this critical security issue. - Users must upgrade to version 15.4.1 or higher to ensure their systems are protected. The discovered vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-25364, is a significant security risk for users of Speedify VPN's macOS application. It resides in the me.connectify.SMJobBlessHelper helper tool, which executes system-level operations with root privileges. The security flaw arises from improper input validation in the XPC interface of this tool, allowing local attackers to inject malicious commands that the system would execute with root privileges. Specifically, the commands can be injected through two user-controlled fields in incoming XPC messages, cmdPath and cmdBin, which are not adequately sanitized. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to local privilege escalation, allowing attackers not only to execute arbitrary commands but also to read, modify, or delete critical system files, and potentially install persistent malware. Speedify has responded to the issue with an updated version that includes a complete rewrite of the flawed helper tool, eliminating the insecure handling of XPC messages and thereby closing this exploit vector. Users are strongly encouraged to update to the latest version to protect their devices from potential exploitation.

CVE-2023-40547,2025-04-22,reddit,"Question about shim and sbat policys in regards to vulnerability: CVE-2023-40547 Hello! I used to dualboot Ubuntu 24.02.4 LTS with Windows 11. Decided to completely remove Windows and was greeted with the ”Verifying shim SBAT data failed: Security Policy Violation”message. After disabling secureboot and reinstalling Ubuntu 24.02.2 LTS I was finally able to boot into linux again with secure boot enabled. Now to my question: As I understand it, Microsoft released an update to mitigate the Shim vulnerability tracked as: CVE-2023-40547 which caused many Linux distros using the vulnerable Shim version to get blocked in Shims own revocations list. I have checked my current Shim version which reports version 15.8, so far so good. . However, I seem to still be using an old Shim revocations list. Command: mokutil —list-sbat-revocations gives me the following output: sbat,1,2023012900 shim,2 grub,3 grub.debian,4 However, Isn’t the new revocations list as follows: sbat,1,2024010900 shim,4 grub,3 grub.debian,4 How do I update the shim revocations list to the latest version?

On April 3, 2025, Gladinet disclosed a vulnerability, CVE-2025-30406 , impacting CentreStack and Triofox servers. The vulnerability is a deserialization vulnerability due to the CentreStack and Triofox portal's hardcoded machineKey use. The vulnerability impacts Gladinet CentreStack through version 16.1.10296.56315 and TrioFox below version 16.4.10317.56372. Is there active exploitation at the time of writing? At the time of writing , Blackpoint’s SOC has observed exploitation of this vulnerability against versions of CentreStack, including some that are fully patched. There is an even chance the patch for CVE-2025-30406 is failing to automatically rotate machineKey’s, which leaves these applications vulnerable. Exploitation of this deserialization vulnerability provides a threat actor remote code execution against the host running CentraStack or Triofox. Threat actors are leveraging this remote execution to enumerate the targeted host and Active Directory Environment. After enumeration, the Blackpoint SOC has observed threat actors that utilize access to remotely execute malicious payloads in memory amongst the following: Read out /etc/hosts Read out boot.ini Read out configuration files Enumerate domain computers, users, admins, trusts Enumerate available shares Enumerate current user and user’s role in domain Enumerate network information Enumerate running processes Read out SAM Hive Download and execute malicious stagers in memory The vulnerability has been reported to be actively exploited since at least March 2025; the vulnerability was added to the U.S. CISA’s Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog on April 08, 2025.

A race condition exists in the AWS4-HMAC (compatible with S3) authorization method of the HTTP component of the FTP server. The server first verifies the existence of the user by performing a call to login_user_pass() with no password requirement. This will authenticate the session through the HMAC verification process and up until the server checks for user verification once more. The vulnerability can be further stabilized, eliminating the need for successfully triggering a race condition, by sending a mangled AWS4-HMAC header. By providing only the username and a following slash (/), the server will successfully find a username, which triggers the successful anypass authentication process, but the server will fail to find the expected SignedHeaders entry, resulting in an index-out-of-bounds error that stops the code from reaching the session cleanup. Together, these issues make it trivial to authenticate as any known or guessable user (e.g., crushadmin), and can lead to a full compromise of the system by obtaining an administrative account.",3.1,9.8,NETWORK,LOW,NONE,NONE,UNCHANGED,HIGH,HIGH,HIGH

The exploit didn’t require the user to do anything beyond opening what looked like a harmless file. This makes it particularly dangerous for less tech-savvy users and internal teams not trained in threat detection. What is known: \- Affected all WhatsApp for Windows versions prior to 2.2450.6 \- Exploited using specially crafted files with manipulated extensions \- Meta confirmed active exploitation before the patch was issued It’s a reminder that even popular desktop apps can become threat vectors when spoofing and user trust intersect.

Security In particular, this addresses the critical security vulnerability CVE-2024-36347 aka ‘EntrySign’, which threatens Ryzen and Epyc CPUs with Zen 1 to Zen 5, and more fast DDR5 RAM. The first manufacturers, such as Asus and MSI, have already released the first BIOS update.The vulnerability CVE-2024-36347 aka ‘EntrySign’ allows attackers to bypass the microcode signature check so that they can gain access to rights at management level. Until now, it was assumed that this critical vulnerability only affected the older Zen iterations . It has now been confirmed that Ryzen and Epyc CPUs based on Zen 5 are also affected, and AMD's latest security report shows that the current Epyc 9005 series server processors, the Ryzen 9000 and Ryzen 9000X3D series desktop CPUs and several mobile CPUs and APUs are also at risk from the vulnerability. The firmware update closes the vulnerability and mitigates the threat. Support for faster memory Following the release of the latest firmware, MSI has also included a memory kit with 192 GiByte DDR5-6000 in its compatibility list for the first time, which is made up of a total of four 48 GiByte memory modules and therefore combines high capacity with high memory speed. In the coming days, all relevant motherboard manufacturers are expected to roll out corresponding BIOS updates with AMD AGESA Combo AM5PI v1.2.0.3c. and Threadripper/Epyc derivatives.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

La tecnica basata sui salvataggi di gioco è stata utilizzata con successo su altre console, ma sulla PlayStation 4 non ha mai portato a un jailbreak completo.\ Intanto gli sviluppatori stanno lavorando per capire se questa scoperta possa evolversi in una soluzione più avanzata.\ A differenza di exploit precedenti, questa tecnica si basa su un errore di tipo double free nella funzione AIO del sistema operativo FreeBSD, che è alla base delle due console PlayStation 4 e PlayStation 5.\ La vulnerabilità, correlata al CVE-2022-2390, riguarda i firmware della console PlayStation 4 dalla versione 5.0 fino alla 12.02, mentre è stata corretta nel firmware 12.50.\ Per console PlayStation 5, l’exploit potrebbe funzionare fino alla versione 10.60, anche se non è ancora stato confermato con certezza se sia stato risolto nel firmware 11.0.\ Un utente anonimo ha condiviso successivamente alcuni dump del kernel che hanno confermato la correzione della vulnerabilità nei firmware più recenti.\ In seguito, il codice della patch è stato reso pubblico, e altri sviluppatori hanno confermato la validità della scoperta sui firmware precedenti.\ \ Stato attuale del jailbreak\ Sulla PlayStation 4, i metodi attualmente disponibili includono:\ \ \ Jailbreak 9.0, basato su exploit WebKit ed exFAT, richiede una chiavetta USB e funziona solo fino al firmware 9.0.\ Exploit PPPwn, rilasciato nel 2023, supporta firmware fino alla verisione 11.0 ma necessita di un dispositivo esterno per inviare il payload.\ \ Questa nuova vulnerabilità potrebbe consentire un jailbreak completamente eseguibile via browser fino al firmware 9.60, eliminando la necessità di dispositivi esterni.\ Per firmware superiori , potrebbe essere sfruttata tramite l’exploit Lua, che però richiede un raro gioco giapponese e un salvataggio modificato, rendendolo poco accessibile.\ Sulla PlayStation 5, la situazione appare più frammentata:\ \ \ L’exploit UMTX permette un jailbreak parziale fino al firmware 5.50 tramite browser, e fino al 7.61 utilizzando Blu-ray o Lua.\ Se confermata, la nuova vulnerabilità potrebbe estendere il jailbreak fino al firmware 10.60, potenzialmente abbinabile ad altri exploit kernel già noti . Tuttavia, l’assenza di un exploit hypervisor limita la possibilità di ottenere un jailbreak completo.\ \ Pare che la console PlayStation 4 possa beneficiare prima dei frutti di questa scoperta, grazie a una base più solida di exploit esistenti.\ Sulla PlayStation 5 invece, la mancanza di un exploit dell'hypervisor e le possibili misure anti-Kstuff nei firmware più recenti rappresentano ostacoli significativi.\ Fonte: x.comDiscover the best curtains shop in Dubai, where style meets quality and customization.

CVE-2024-21762,2025-04-27,reddit,"FINAL FIREWALL MIGRATION PLAN Hello All, TLDR at the bottom. This is the first time I've undertaken a firewall migration project like this so to say I'm experiencing nervousness/imposter syndrome would be an understatement . so any encouragement, feedback or hard truths are greatly appreciated. That said, in preparation for a firewall migration I've been working on manually building this firewall config for a while now in Eve-NG and so far everything is working the way it should . I think I'm just about done wrapping it up as we're nearing our deployment date so I wanted to see if there were any holes in my plan . As you can see in the diagram we're migrating 3 Cisco ASAs to a single 400 series Fortigate . The main reason for the migration is to upgrade speeds from 2G to 10G and to modernize our equipment.

A race condition exists in the AWS4-HMAC (compatible with S3) authorization method of the HTTP component of the FTP server. The server first verifies the existence of the user by performing a call to login_user_pass() with no password requirement. This will authenticate the session through the HMAC verification process and up until the server checks for user verification once more. The vulnerability can be further stabilized, eliminating the need for successfully triggering a race condition, by sending a mangled AWS4-HMAC header. By providing only the username and a following slash (/), the server will successfully find a username, which triggers the successful anypass authentication process, but the server will fail to find the expected SignedHeaders entry, resulting in an index-out-of-bounds error that stops the code from reaching the session cleanup. Together, these issues make it trivial to authenticate as any known or guessable user (e.g., crushadmin), and can lead to a full compromise of the system by obtaining an administrative account.",3.1,9.8,NETWORK,LOW,NONE,NONE,UNCHANGED,HIGH,HIGH,HIGH

exec: Force single empty string when argv is empty

Quoting[1] Ariadne Conill:

""In several other operating systems, it is a hard requirement that the
second argument to execve(2) be the name of a program, thus prohibiting
a scenario where argc < 1. POSIX 2017 also recommends this behaviour,
but it is not an explicit requirement[2]:

    The argument arg0 should point to a filename string that is
    associated with the process being started by one of the exec
    functions.
...
Interestingly, Michael Kerrisk opened an issue about this in 2008[3],
but there was no consensus to support fixing this issue then.
Hopefully now that CVE-2021-4034 shows practical exploitative use[4]
of this bug in a shellcode, we can reconsider.

This issue is being tracked in the KSPP issue tracker[5].""

While the initial code searches[6][7] turned up what appeared to be
mostly corner case tests, trying to that just reject argv == NULL
(or an immediately terminated pointer list) quickly started tripping[8]
existing userspace programs.

The next best approach is forcing a single empty string into argv and
adjusting argc to match. The number of programs depending on argc == 0
seems a smaller set than those calling execve with a NULL argv.

Account for the additional stack space in bprm_stack_limits(). Inject an
empty string when argc == 0 (and set argc = 1). Warn about the case so
userspace has some notice about the change:

    process './argc0' launched './argc0' with NULL argv: empty string added

Additionally WARN() and reject NULL argv usage for kernel threads.

mm/mremap: fix move_normal_pmd/retract_page_tables race

In mremap(), move_page_tables() looks at the type of the PMD entry and the
specified address range to figure out by which method the next chunk of
page table entries should be moved.

At that point, the mmap_lock is held in write mode, but no rmap locks are
held yet.  For PMD entries that point to page tables and are fully covered
by the source address range, move_pgt_entry(NORMAL_PMD, ...) is called,
which first takes rmap locks, then does move_normal_pmd(). 
move_normal_pmd() takes the necessary page table locks at source and
destination, then moves an entire page table from the source to the
destination.

The problem is: The rmap locks, which protect against concurrent page
table removal by retract_page_tables() in the THP code, are only taken
after the PMD entry has been read and it has been decided how to move it. 
So we can race as follows (with two processes that have mappings of the
same tmpfs file that is stored on a tmpfs mount with huge=advise); note
that process A accesses page tables through the MM while process B does it
through the file rmap:

process A                      process B

        get_old_pmd
        alloc_new_pmd
                      *** PREEMPT ***
                               madvise(MADV_COLLAPSE)
                                 do_madvise
                                   madvise_walk_vmas
                                     madvise_vma_behavior
                                       madvise_collapse
                                         hpage_collapse_scan_file
                                           collapse_file
                                             retract_page_tables
                                               i_mmap_lock_read(mapping)
                                               pmdp_collapse_flush
                                               i_mmap_unlock_read(mapping)
        move_pgt_entry(NORMAL_PMD, ...)
          take_rmap_locks
          move_normal_pmd
          drop_rmap_locks

When this happens, move_normal_pmd() can end up creating bogus PMD entries
in the line `pmd_populate(mm, new_pmd, pmd_pgtable(pmd))`.  The effect
depends on arch-specific and machine-specific details; on x86, you can end
up with physical page 0 mapped as a page table, which is likely
exploitable for user->kernel privilege escalation.

Fix the race by letting process B recheck that the PMD still points to a
page table after the rmap locks have been taken.  Otherwise, we bail and
let the caller fall back to the PTE-level copying path, which will then
bail immediately at the pmd_none() check.

Bug reachability: Reaching this bug requires that you can create
shmem/file THP mappings - anonymous THP uses different code that doesn't
zap stuff under rmap locks.  File THP is gated on an experimental config
flag (CONFIG_READ_ONLY_THP_FOR_FS), so on normal distro kernels you need
shmem THP to hit this bug.  As far as I know, getting shmem THP normally
requires that you can mount your own tmpfs with the right mount flags,
which would require creating your own user+mount namespace; though I don't
know if some distros maybe enable shmem THP by default or something like
that.

Bug impact: This issue can likely be used for user->kernel privilege
escalation when it is reachable.",3.1,7.0,LOCAL,HIGH,LOW,NONE,UNCHANGED,HIGH,HIGH,HIGH

CVE-2024-38812,2025-04-22,telegram,"I have finalized the list of trending vulnerabilities for 2024 according to Positive Technologies. Last year, 74 vulnerabilities were classified as trending . All trending vulnerabilities are found in Western commercial products and open source projects. This year, the vulnerabilities of domestic Russian products did not reach the level of criticality required to classify them as trending. For 55 of all trending vulnerabilities there are currently signs of exploitation in attacks, for 17 there are public exploits and for the remaining 2 there is only a possibility of future exploitation. Vulnerabilities were often added to trending ones before signs of exploitation in the wild appeared. For example, the remote code execution vulnerability in VMware vCenter (( was added to the list of trending vulnerabilities on September 20, 3 days after the vendor's security bulletin appeared. There were no signs of exploitation in the wild or public exploit for this vulnerability. Signs of exploitation appeared only 2 months later, on November 18. Most of the vulnerabilities in the trending list are of the following types: Remote Code or Command Execution and Elevation of Privilege . 4 vulnerabilities in Barracuda Email Security Gateway (( MOVEit Transfer (( papercut (( and SugarCRM (( were added in early January 2024. These vulnerabilities were massively exploited in the West in 2023, and attacks using these vulnerabilities could also tangentially affect those domestic Russian organizations where these products had not yet been taken out of service. The rest of the vulnerabilities became trending in 2024. 34 trending vulnerabilities affect Microsoft products . 17 of them are Elevation of Privilege vulnerabilities in the Windows kernel and standard components. 1 Remote Code Execution vulnerability in Windows Remote Desktop Licensing Service (( 2 trending Elevation of Privilege vulnerabilities affect Linux systems: one in nftables (( and the second in needrestart (( Other groups of vulnerabilities Phishing attacks: 19 Network security and entry points: 13 Virtual infrastructure and backups: 7 Software development: 6 Collaboration tools: 3 CMS WordPress plugins: 3 ( Article on the official website "" ( #TrendVulns #PositiveTechnologies #Barracuda #MOVEitTransfer #papercut #SugarCRM #Microsoft #Windows #RDLS #Linux #nftables #needrestart #Windows #Ghostscript #Outlook #Exchange #Roundcube #PaloAlto #Fortinet #Juniper #Ivanti #CheckPoint #Zyxel #VMware #Veeam #Acronis #GitLab #TeamCity #Jenkins #PHP #FluentBit #Struts #Atlassian #Confluence #XWiki #WordPress #LiteSpeedCache #TheEventsCalendar #HunkCompanion",0.5801,9.8,The vCenter Server contains a heap-overflow vulnerability in the implementation of the DCERPC protocol. A malicious actor with network access to vCenter Server may trigger this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted network packet potentially leading to remote code execution.,3.1,9.8,NETWORK,LOW,NONE,NONE,UNCHANGED,HIGH,HIGH,HIGH

The mitigation for CVE-2024-50379 was incomplete.

Users running Tomcat on a case insensitive file system with the default servlet write enabled (readonly initialisation 
parameter set to the non-default value of false) may need additional configuration to fully mitigate CVE-2024-50379 depending on which version of Java they are using with Tomcat:
- running on Java 8 or Java 11: the system property sun.io.useCanonCaches must be explicitly set to false (it defaults to true)
- running on Java 17: the system property sun.io.useCanonCaches, if set, must be set to false (it defaults to false)
- running on Java 21 onwards: no further configuration is required (the system property and the problematic cache have been removed)

Tomcat 11.0.3, 10.1.35 and 9.0.99 onwards will include checks that sun.io.useCanonCaches is set appropriately before allowing the default servlet to be write enabled on a case insensitive file system.

The Butterfly framework uses the `java.net.URL` class to refer to (what are expected to be) local resource files, like images or templates. This works: ""opening a connection"" to these URLs opens the local file. However, prior to version 1.2.6, if a `file:/` URL is directly given where a relative path (resource name) is expected, this is also accepted in some code paths; the app then fetches the file, from a remote machine if indicated, and uses it as if it was a trusted part of the app's codebase. This leads to multiple weaknesses and potential weaknesses. An attacker that has network access to the application could use it to gain access to files, either on the the server's filesystem (path traversal) or shared by nearby machines (server-side request forgery with e.g. SMB). An attacker that can lead or redirect a user to a crafted URL belonging to the app could cause arbitrary attacker-controlled JavaScript to be loaded in the victim's browser (cross-site scripting).

Thanks to Thomas Gleixner's analysis, the issue is caused by the low
initial period (1) of the frequency estimation algorithm, which triggers
the defects of the HW, specifically erratum HSW11 and HSW143. (For the
details, please refer https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/87plq9l5d2.ffs@tglx/)

The HSW11 requires a period larger than 100 for the INST_RETIRED.ALL
event, but the initial period in the freq mode is 1. The erratum is the
same as the BDM11, which has been supported in the kernel. A minimum
period of 128 is enforced as well on HSW.

HSW143 is regarding that the fixed counter 1 may overcount 32 with the
Hyper-Threading is enabled. However, based on the test, the hardware
has more issues than it tells. Besides the fixed counter 1, the message
'interrupt took too long' can be observed on any counter which was armed
with a period < 32 and two events expired in the same NMI. A minimum
period of 32 is enforced for the rest of the events.
The recommended workaround code of the HSW143 is not implemented.
Because it only addresses the issue for the fixed counter. It brings
extra overhead through extra MSR writing. No related overcounting issue
has been reported so far.",3.1,5.5,LOCAL,LOW,LOW,NONE,UNCHANGED,NONE,NONE,HIGH

exec: Force single empty string when argv is empty

Quoting[1] Ariadne Conill:

""In several other operating systems, it is a hard requirement that the
second argument to execve(2) be the name of a program, thus prohibiting
a scenario where argc < 1. POSIX 2017 also recommends this behaviour,
but it is not an explicit requirement[2]:

    The argument arg0 should point to a filename string that is
    associated with the process being started by one of the exec
    functions.
...
Interestingly, Michael Kerrisk opened an issue about this in 2008[3],
but there was no consensus to support fixing this issue then.
Hopefully now that CVE-2021-4034 shows practical exploitative use[4]
of this bug in a shellcode, we can reconsider.

This issue is being tracked in the KSPP issue tracker[5].""

While the initial code searches[6][7] turned up what appeared to be
mostly corner case tests, trying to that just reject argv == NULL
(or an immediately terminated pointer list) quickly started tripping[8]
existing userspace programs.

The next best approach is forcing a single empty string into argv and
adjusting argc to match. The number of programs depending on argc == 0
seems a smaller set than those calling execve with a NULL argv.

Account for the additional stack space in bprm_stack_limits(). Inject an
empty string when argc == 0 (and set argc = 1). Warn about the case so
userspace has some notice about the change:

    process './argc0' launched './argc0' with NULL argv: empty string added

Additionally WARN() and reject NULL argv usage for kernel threads.

CVE-2024-36347,2025-04-28,reddit,"Should I update my BIOS? Hi everyone! In early 2023 I built a PC from scratch by buying all the parts from Amazon/other sellers. My current setup is: - Gigabyte B650 Aorus Elite AX - Ryzen 5 7600 - AMD RX 6750XT - 2x 16 GB Corsair RAM 6000 MHz . The setup was smooth, everything is working fine. Let's say I'm good at following instructions. My only issue right now is that the PC takes a little bit to boot up, more than a minute. It's not a big deal, but feels like a lot more than it would take for a modern pc running SSD. Back then I read that it was due to the early bios build. Fast forward today, I somehow thought ""should I update the BIOS?"" I checked and it appears I have F1 version, released on 26/8/2022. That version is no longer even listed on the official Gigabyte download page. Should I update it? I'm not an expert, but I'm not even a complete newbie. Just to provide background I've got a MSc Degree in Computer Science Engineering and currently working in IT field. But I've never flashed a BIOS, I'm more a software guy than a hardware one, I've never worked on very low-level stuff. I've read online that the operation is recommended only if strictly required, but I've also read that it's an old thing and nowadays it's a safer operation. Also I've seen that the various BIOS versions cover at least three major security updates . And also implement a voltage limit on the CPU recommended by AMD. What would you do?",,,,,,,,,,,,,

CVE-2025-21756,2025-04-29,reddit,"Local root vulnerability, CVE-2025-21756",0.00018,7.8,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vsock: Keep the binding until socket destruction

Preserve sockets bindings; this includes both resulting from an explicit
bind() and those implicitly bound through autobind during connect().

Prevents socket unbinding during a transport reassignment, which fixes a
use-after-free:

    1. vsock_create() (refcnt=1) calls vsock_insert_unbound() (refcnt=2)
    2. transport->release() calls vsock_remove_bound() without checking if
       sk was bound and moved to bound list (refcnt=1)
    3. vsock_bind() assumes sk is in unbound list and before
       __vsock_insert_bound(vsock_bound_sockets()) calls
       __vsock_remove_bound() which does:
           list_del_init(&vsk->bound_table); // nop
           sock_put(&vsk->sk);               // refcnt=0

CVE-2025-24200,2025-05-02,reddit,"Stolen 2019 MacBook Pro – Find My “Erase Pending” but thieves reinstalled Catalina and are on the desktop. How did they bypass Activation Lock & what data did they get? So here's the situation. My 2019 16-inch Intel MacBook Pro and 2017 iPad Pro were stolen a few days ago from a cafe. As soon as I realized, I logged into iCloud and triggered both “Erase Device” and “Mark As Lost” via Find My — this was within 10 minutes of the theft. The devices showed up shortly after in a place in my city that’s notorious for being where all stolen electronics go — like a central market for used parts, stolen electronics, jailbroken devices, etc. Two days later, I managed to get someone with a “connection” inside that place to send me a photo of the Mac. And here’s the crazy part: it was booted up, on the macOS Catalina 10.15.7 desktop. They even sent me the About This Mac screen showing my exact serial number — no doubt it’s mine. But the OS is downgraded from Ventura 13.6.1 to Catalina. I can’t see the user folders or whether my desktop files are there — they only sent me the About screen — but no information in the desktop items. Meanwhile, Find My still shows the Mac as “Erase Pending”, which suggests it hasn’t gone online since the theft — or if it has, it’s on a filtered network. I’m not sure if I had FileVault enabled. I think not. No firmware or startup password either, but my only User did have a 24 digit password. Find My was enabled, and I’ve always had 2FA on my Apple ID. So… how did they pull this off? What I think they did Booted into Recovery Mode . No password needed. Opened Disk Utility and wiped the internal drive. Reinstalled Catalina . Never connected to Wi-Fi, or they blocked Apple activation servers . During Setup Assistant, since there’s no connection, macOS never checks with Apple’s servers, so Activation Lock doesn’t kick in. They create a new admin user and boot to the desktop. And now… they're just sitting on a Catalina machine, not sure if they managed to get online or not, but I would guess so, as they sell these stolen devices. They’re known in that area for selling “unlocked” Macs, so I’m wondering if they did something more advanced — maybe some Activation Lock bypass or hardware trick? Questions I’m hoping someone here can help with: 1. Does this flow sound technically correct? Is it really this “easy” if FileVault was off and Recovery Mode isn’t locked down? 2. Is it likely they accessed my data before wiping? Could they have just reset the password via Recovery or deleted .AppleSetupDone to make a new admin and snoop around before erasing? 3. Are there real-world ways to actually kill Activation Lock on T2 Macs? Like logic board swaps, or any of those gray-market “checkm8-T2” tools? 4. Anything else I should be doing now? I've left the device in iCloud with Erase Pending, and I've rotated every important password and token I can think of. Stuff I’ve been reading that might be relevant The usual resetpassword trick in Recovery works fine if FileVault’s off. You can reset or create users with no Apple ID needed. There was CVE-2025-24200 — a USB restricted mode bypass — but it doesn’t seem needed here since FileVault was off. The old “reset NVRAM to disable Find My” trick doesn’t apply anymore — Apple patched that years ago . I’ve read rumors about checkm8-based tools unlocking T2 Macs, but haven’t seen credible confirmation that it works post-erase and online. I’m trying to fully understand the actual limitations of Activation Lock and Find My in practice — especially when FileVault isn’t on. Apple implies “your data is safe,” but this sure feels like it’s not unless encryption is on too. Happy to answer anything that helps figure this out. I appreciate any insight — whether you've seen this before or have deeper technical knowledge about how Apple’s activation flow works. Thanks. TL;DR: My 2019 MacBook Pro was stolen.

No password needed. \ Opened Disk Utility and wiped the internal drive. \ Reinstalled Catalina . \ Never connected to Wi-Fi, or they blocked Apple activation servers . \ During Setup Assistant, since there’s no connection, macOS never checks with Apple’s servers, so Activation Lock doesn’t kick in. \ They create a new admin user and boot to the desktop. And now… they're just sitting on a Catalina machine, not sure if they managed to get online or not, but I would guess so, as they sell these stolen devices. They’re known in that area for selling “unlocked” Macs, so I’m wondering if they did something more advanced — maybe some Activation Lock bypass or hardware trick? \# Questions I’m hoping someone here can help with: 1. \\Does this flow sound technically correct?\\ Is it really this “easy” if FileVault was off and Recovery Mode isn’t locked down? 2. \\Is it likely they accessed my data before wiping?\\ Could they have just reset the password via Recovery or deleted \.AppleSetupDone\ to make a new admin and snoop around \before\ erasing? 3. \\Are there real-world ways to actually kill Activation Lock on T2 Macs?\\ Like logic board swaps, or any of those gray-market “checkm8-T2” tools? 4. \\Anything else I should be doing now?\\ I've left the device in iCloud with Erase Pending, and I've rotated every important password and token I can think of. \# Stuff I’ve been reading that might be relevant \ The usual \resetpassword\ trick in Recovery works fine if FileVault’s off. You can reset or create users with no Apple ID needed. \ There was CVE-2025-24200 — a USB restricted mode bypass — but it doesn’t seem needed here since FileVault was off. \ The old “reset NVRAM to disable Find My” trick doesn’t apply anymore — Apple patched that years ago . \ I’ve read rumors about checkm8-based tools unlocking T2 Macs, but haven’t seen credible confirmation that it works post-erase \and\ online. I’m trying to fully understand the actual limitations of Activation Lock and Find My in practice — especially when FileVault isn’t on. Apple implies “your data is safe,” but this sure feels like it’s not unless encryption is on too. Happy to answer anything that helps figure this out. I appreciate any insight — whether you've seen this before or have deeper technical knowledge about how Apple’s activation flow works. Thanks. TL;DR: My 2019 MacBook Pro was stolen. Find My shows ""Erase Pending"", but someone sent me a pic of it booted into Catalina, logged into a new user . How did they downgrade, erase, and get to the desktop without triggering Activation Lock? FileVault was likely off.

CVE-2025-32433,2025-04-18,mastodon,"Whoa, heads up cybersecurity folks! There's a particularly nasty bug making the rounds: CVE-2025-32433 in Erlang/OTP SSH. And yes, it scored a perfect CVSS 10.0 . We're talking potential unauthorized remote code execution here. Basically, an attacker can sneak SSH messages through before any authentication even happens. Think about that for a second. If your SSH daemon happens to be running as root. well, that's pretty much game over for the system. This isn't just a minor issue; it impacts anyone using the Erlang/OTP SSH implementation. The good news? Patches are available! You'll want to update to one of these versions ASAP: OTP-27.3.3 OTP-26.2.5.11 OTP-25.3.2.20 Speaking as a pentester, gotta say, that's a clever vulnerability path . Another thing to keep in mind: your typical automated vulnerability scanners might completely miss this one due to the pre-auth nature. So, what's your take? Have any of you run into this yet or started testing for it? Curious to know what tools you're finding effective for detection or exploitation testing!

The CVE program, which is a global standard for identifying and tracking publicly disclosed gaps in software security, is used by companies such as Microsoft, Google, Apple, Intel or AMD. Lack of further financing may threaten its functioning. Mitre received funds for the CVE program from the US National Security Department and the Infrastructure Cyber security and security agency . Yosry Barsoum, vice president of Mitre, said that the organization remains involved in maintaining the program as a global resource, and the US government makes efforts to support its role. However, the expiry of the contract, which was the first to inform the letter leakage to members of the CVE board published on X and BlueSky platforms, raises concerns about the future of the program. And that we would be aware of the seriousness of the situation: CVE, i.e. Common Vulnerabilies and Exposures, is an international system for identifying, cataloging and public disclosure of gaps in software security and IT systems. Its purpose is to ensure a standard way to describe and track susceptibility, which enables companies, researchers and specialists in cyber security to quickly recognize threats, assess their seriousness and prioritize repair activities. The program is managed by Mitre Corporation, a non-profit organization, with financial support, among others, the US National Security Department . Each gap reported under the program receives a unique CVE identifier in the ""CVE-ROK-NUMER"" format , which allows it to be clearly identified in global databases. CVE records contain a description of vulnerability, its potential impact and, as far as possible, reference to corrections or remedies. The system is used by the largest technology companies such as Microsoft, Google, Apple, Intel and AMD, as well as government organizations and independent researchers. Do you understand what this database means due to lack of financing? The Cve program is about to go dark. Mitre just confirmed their funding to run cve and cwe expires tomorrow. That’s the main database the world relies on to track know vulnerabites in software. Yes, The Cve. The backbone of the entire vuln ecosystem. No cves = no shared . pic.twitter.com/4bwcpxia1v - Feross April 15, 2025 Although Mitre's historical CVE records will remain available on the GitHub website, but this is also another suggestion that in the absence of new financing, new Luka may not be cataloged. Over 400 organizations such as Google, Apple or Microsoft are involved in the work on CVE, which play the role of CVE Numbering Authorities and issue CVE identifiers, which can partly alleviate the effects of lack of financing. Details of potential new sources of financing or impact on current program operations have not been given, but the situation is monitored by the cyber security community. It is very possible that this movement of the American administration is aimed at forcing financing the issue of cyber security by entities that should be most interested in the reliability of their own solutions, i.e. large, technological players. However, there is also a minus of this approach: selected companies may not be interested in publishing information on gaps in their own solutions, which in effect degrade global security. The existing gap base implemented as part of the CVE program was a benefit for users of IT solutions as well as for producers. Lack of financing the CVE program can disturb this order. One thing is certain: any disorders in cybersecurity infrastructure are delighted with cybercriminals.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prior to 0.6.1, AutoGPT allows of leakage of cross-domain cookies and protected headers in requests redirect. AutoGPT uses a wrapper around the requests python library, located in autogpt_platform/backend/backend/util/request.py. In this wrapper, redirects are specifically NOT followed for the first request. If the wrapper is used with allow_redirects set to True (which is the default), any redirect is not followed by the initial request, but rather re-requested by the wrapper using the new location. However, there is a fundamental flaw in manually re-requesting the new location: it does not account for security-sensitive headers which should not be sent cross-origin, such as the Authorization and Proxy-Authorization header, and cookies. For example in autogpt_platform/backend/backend/blocks/github/_api.py, an Authorization header is set when retrieving data from the GitHub API. However, if GitHub suffers from an open redirect vulnerability (such as the made-up example of https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/comments/{comment_id}/../../../../../redirect/?url=https://joshua.hu/), and the script can be coerced into visiting it with the Authorization header, the GitHub credentials in the Authorization header will be leaked.

CVE-2024-4040,2025-04-08,mastodon,"Just another Monday in IT, right? Dealing with CrushFTP, the CISA KEV list, and active exploits. So, let's talk about CVE-2024-4040 . It’s a tricky authentication bypass vulnerability. While that might sound a bit technical, the bottom line is it's seriously critical. Why? Because unauthenticated attackers could potentially log in as any user and basically hijack the entire system. Yikes. Now, CISA has flagged this one, adding it to their Known Exploited Vulnerabilities list. Their advice? Get patching done by April 28th! You know, this probably impacts quite a few places that might not even have it on their radar yet. Why am I even posting about this? Well, because relying solely on automated scans often isn't enough – they can miss things like this. This is exactly the kind of vulnerability that thorough pentesting is designed to uncover. Plus, let's be honest, your clients will thank you big time for spotting and fixing these issues before things go boom. Here’s a quick action plan: Get those systems updated ASAP! Give your setups a thorough check. Time for a password reset on affected accounts. Make sure you've got 2FA turned on wherever possible. Keep a close watch on your network activity. Over to you: What are your go-to tools for hunting down vulnerabilities like this one?

CVE-2024-36904,2025-03-21,mastodon,"SECURITY ALERT: Researchers have published exploit code for a critical Linux kernel vulnerability that could allow attackers to manipulate memory and launch DoS attacks. Our latest article explains the risks and urgent steps system administrators should take to protect their infrastructure. ,SecurityLand ,LinuxSecurity ,CyberSecurity ,CVE ,PoC ,LinuxKernel security.land/critical-linux-k ernel-vulnerability-poc-released-for-CVE-2024-36904/",0.0062,,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tcp: Use refcount_inc_not_zero() in tcp_twsk_unique().

Anderson Nascimento reported a use-after-free splat in tcp_twsk_unique()
with nice analysis.

Since commit ec94c2696f0b (""tcp/dccp: avoid one atomic operation for
timewait hashdance""), inet_twsk_hashdance() sets TIME-WAIT socket's
sk_refcnt after putting it into ehash and releasing the bucket lock.

Thus, there is a small race window where other threads could try to
reuse the port during connect() and call sock_hold() in tcp_twsk_unique()
for the TIME-WAIT socket with zero refcnt.

If that happens, the refcnt taken by tcp_twsk_unique() is overwritten
and sock_put() will cause underflow, triggering a real use-after-free
somewhere else.

To avoid the use-after-free, we need to use refcount_inc_not_zero() in
tcp_twsk_unique() and give up on reusing the port if it returns false.

[0]:
refcount_t: addition on 0; use-after-free.

CVE-2025-27148,2025-02-25,mastodon,"CVE-2025-27148 - Gradle Native-Platform Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability February 25, 2025 at 09:15PM <URL> ,CVE ,IOC ,CTI ,ThreatIntelligence ,ThreatIntel ,Cybersecurity ,Recon",,8.8,"Gradle is a build automation tool, and its native-platform tool provides Java bindings for native APIs. On Unix-like systems, the system temporary directory can be created with open permissions that allow multiple users to create and delete files within it. This library initialization could be vulnerable to a local privilege escalation from an attacker quickly deleting and recreating files in the system temporary directory. Gradle builds that rely on versions of net.rubygrapefruit:native-platform prior to 0.22-milestone-28 could be vulnerable to a local privilege escalation from an attacker quickly deleting and recreating files in the system temporary directory.

In net.rubygrapefruit:native-platform prior to version 0.22-milestone-28, if the `Native.get(Class<>)` method was called, without calling `Native.init(File)` first, with a non-`null` argument used as working file path, then the library would initialize itself using the system temporary directory and NativeLibraryLocator.java lines 68 through 78. Version 0.22-milestone-28 has been released with changes that fix the problem. Initialization is now mandatory and no longer uses the system temporary directory, unless such a path is passed for initialization. The only workaround for affected versions is to make sure to do a proper initialization, using a location that is safe.

Gradle 8.12, only that exact version, had codepaths where the initialization of the underlying native integration library took a default path, relying on copying the binaries to the system temporary directory. Any execution of Gradle exposed this exploit. Users of Windows or modern versions of macOS are not vulnerable, nor are users of a Unix-like operating system with the ""sticky"" bit set or `noexec` on their system temporary directory vulnerable. This problem was fixed in Gradle 8.12.1. Gradle 8.13 release also upgrades to a version of the native library that no longer has that bug. Some workarounds are available. On Unix-like operating systems, ensure that the ""sticky"" bit is set. This only allows the original user (or root) to delete a file. Mounting `/tmp` as `noexec` will prevent Gradle 8.12 from starting. Those who are are unable to change the permissions of the system temporary directory can move the Java temporary directory by setting the System Property java.io.tmpdir. The new path needs to limit permissions to the build user only.",3.1,8.8,LOCAL,LOW,LOW,NONE,CHANGED,HIGH,HIGH,HIGH

When the storage sync operation is triggered, the application attempts to make S3 API calls to the specified endpoint, effectively making HTTP requests to the target service and returning the response in error messages. This SSRF vulnerability enables attackers to bypass network segmentation and access internal services that should not be accessible from the external network. The vulnerability is particularly severe because error messages from failed requests contain the full response body, allowing data exfiltration from internal services.

Prior to version 0.14.1, a malicious SecureDrop Server could obtain code execution on the SecureDrop Client virtual machine (`sd-app`). SecureDrop Server itself has multiple layers of built-in hardening, and is a dedicated physical machine exposed on the internet only via Tor hidden services for the Source and Journalist interfaces, and optionally via remote SSH access over another Tor hidden service. A newsroom's SecureDrop Workstation communicates only with its own dedicated SecureDrop Server.

The SecureDrop Client runs in a dedicated Qubes virtual machine, named `sd-app`, as part of the SecureDrop Workstation. The private OpenPGP key used to decrypt submissions and replies is stored in a separate virtual machine and never accessed directly. The vulnerability lies in the code responsible for downloading replies. The filename of the reply is obtained from the `Content-Disposition` HTTP header and used to write the encrypted reply on disk. Note that filenames are generated and sanitized server-side, and files are downloaded in an encrypted format, so a remote attacker who has not achieved server compromise, such as one posing as a source, could not craft the HTTP response necessary for this attack.

While the filename is later checked to guard against path traversal before being moved into the Client’s data storage directory, the file has already been written to a potentially arbitrary location. In this case, `safe_move()` would detect the path traversal and fail, leaving the original downloaded file in the attacker-chosen directory. Code execution can be gained by writing an autostart file in `/home/user/.config/autostart/`.

Version 0.14.1 fixes the issue. As of time of publication, there is no known evidence of exploitation in the wild. This attack requires a previously compromised SecureDrop Server.",3.1,8.1,NETWORK,HIGH,NONE,NONE,UNCHANGED,HIGH,HIGH,HIGH

CrowdStrike has identified a validation logic error in the Falcon sensor for Linux, Falcon Kubernetes Admission Controller, and Falcon Container Sensor where our TLS connection routine to the CrowdStrike cloud can incorrectly process server certificate validation. This could allow an attacker with the ability to control network traffic to potentially conduct a man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack. CrowdStrike identified this issue internally and released a security fix in all Falcon sensor for Linux, Falcon Kubernetes Admission Controller, and Falcon Container Sensor versions 7.06 and above.

 
CrowdStrike identified this issue through our longstanding, rigorous security review process, which has been continually strengthened with deeper source code analysis and ongoing program enhancements as part of our commitment to security resilience. CrowdStrike has no indication of any exploitation of this issue in the wild. CrowdStrike has leveraged its world class threat hunting and intelligence capabilities to actively monitor for signs of abuse or usage of this flaw and will continue to do so.

Prior to version 12.25Q1.1, due to an improper implementation of the logout process, authentication credentials remain in cookies even after a user has explicitly logged out, which may allow an attacker to steal authentication tokens. This could have devastating consequences if a user with admin privileges is (or was) using a shared device. Users who have logged in on a shared device should go to Settings > Security and regenerate their login tokens. Version 12.25Q1.1 fixes the issue. As a workaround, clear cookies and site data in the browser after logging out.",3.1,9.3,LOCAL,LOW,NONE,NONE,CHANGED,HIGH,HIGH,HIGH

Due to a lack of CSRF countermeasures and improper settings of cookies for MediaProxy authentication, there is a vulnerability that allows MediaProxy authentication to be bypassed. In versions prior to 12.25Q1.1, the authentication cookie does not have the SameSite attribute. This allows an attacker to bypass MediaProxy authentication and load any image without restrictions under certain circumstances. In versions prior to 12.24Q2.3, this cookie was also used to authenticate the job queue management page (bull-board), so bull-board authentication is also bypassed. This may enable attacks that have a significant impact on availability and integrity.
The affected versions are too old to be covered by this advisory, but the maintainers of Concorde strongly recommend not using older versions. Version 12.25Q1.1 contains a patch. There is no effective workaround other than updating.",3.1,8.6,NETWORK,LOW,NONE,NONE,CHANGED,NONE,NONE,HIGH
