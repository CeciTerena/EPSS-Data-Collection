    "clean_text": "Why does Defender hate Fan Control? An explanation of Windows Drivers, WinRing0.sys, and its 7.8 CVE score: #TL;DR * Windows Defender is not wrong, per se. `WinRing0` DOES has a vulnerability that lets unprivileged programs *hack into Windows. * Fan Control is not malicious, `WinRing0` is not malicious, but a malicious program can use `WinRing0` to bypass your system's security measures because it has a vulnerability. * Read source 1 for the technical details. * You don't have to read this entire wall of text, skip to the headers that interests you. # Introduction Hello everyone! As you probably found out by now, Fan Control's implementation is currently broken. This is due to the kernel driver that Fan Control uses `WinRing0` being blocked by Windows Defender. I want to clarify a few things I learned while researching this and show a bit of behind the scenes of how your computer talks to Fan Control and why Defender has blocked it. # Pet Peeve First off, as a computer scientist it pains me to see people's knee jerk reaction is to override their operating system's security systems. It's there to protect you, yes it can make mistakes, but you should generally wait for an official response or similar understanding and you shouldn't do it blindly. Your security means nothing if you override your security when it's inconvenient. It's kind of like taking the carbon monoxide alarm off the wall because you don't like that it's beeping super loudly. Anyways. # What is a driver and why do we need them? ^(skip to next header if you don't care how drivers work) To answer why Defender has blocked fan Control, I first have to explain how Fan Control works with Windows. I'll try to keep this explanation as simple as possible. *^(Asterisks indicate an oversimplification for clarity) Window's main job is to manage a bunch of different applications and allow them to talk to the hardware. In old times it used to be the case that a program can tell the computer to do whatever it wants. This was a problem because it could mess up other programs, crash the entire system, and do malicious things. So to fix this, operating systems (OS) now split up the computer's memory and give a piece to each application. This application now has its own space to do things, called user-space. Each application is *only allowed to do things in its own piece of memory and nothing else. If the application crashed, the OS can throw away the application & its piece of memory and everything else on the system will be fine. This has a big problem though: applications isolated in user-space could not talk to hardware! If you can talk to the hardware, you can do anything to the system, so it's an intentional protection. But your hardware needs to talk to the operating system to work, but there is too many pieces of hardware that all work differently. Windows doesn't know how to talk to all of them! So we need these programs that can interface with hardware but can't live in user-space. But at the same time we want the kind of protection that user-space gives. The solution is drivers: special programs that can receive special exceptions to live in *kernel-space. Kernel-space is the opposite of user-space. You can do anything in kernel-space! Like talk to hardware to control your fans or read your credit card number when you pay for something. Because kernel-space drivers are so high risk Microsoft gate keeps them with an iron fist, kinda like Apple's non-EU app store on iPhones. # Fan Control used a driver called `WinRing0` Fan Control cannot talk directly to your hardware. It can talk to a driver, and that driver can talk to the hardware. There are a few different drivers and api's Fan Control uses, but the main one was `WinRing0`. ### Who made `WinRing0`? `WinRing0` is a third party driver developed by OpenLibSys. ### Who convinced Microsoft to let `WinRing0` be a driver with privileges? The company called EVGA convinced Microsoft. Why? Because EVGA made software that used the third party driver. They don't use it anymore because it was vulnerable. # `WinRing0` is a vulnerable driver! This is why Defender hates `WinRing0`. On August 11th, 2020 a security researcher named Matt Hand published¬π the vulnerability report for `WinRing0` proving that it had a high-risk privilege escalation exploit. This means a user-space program can take control of this driver* and then use it to gain kernel-space privileges. This means a lowly application can take advantage of `WinRing0` to do whatever it wants to your computer! When this was discovered, EVGA abandoned `WinRing0` and made their own proprietary driver that they use. The developers of `WinRing0` can fix the driver, but under Microsoft's modern strict driver rules, an updated `WinRing0` won't make it past Microsoft's driver gate keepers. Many projects used and still use this driver. That's why Microsoft couldn't just cut support outright for the driver- too many things would break all at once. But `WinRing0` was on borrowed time, Microsoft planned to cut the driver in 2024, but then they pushed it back to Jan 2025. And now Microsoft seems to start following through. # What are the risks of running a vulnerable driver? Well a vulnerable driver is basically a front door to your house that you cannot lock. If everyone in town is friendly, you're good. But all it takes is one malicious actor to recognize the vulnerable door and waltz right on in. The door still functions, and friendly programs like Fan Control are respectful when they have to go in your house through the door. But you are less protected while having it installed. I would recommend listening to Defender. If you choose to override Defender, know that your OS's front door is open, and any program you run can use it for whatever they wish. # Sources 1) Matt Hand (security researcher), https://medium.com/@matterpreter/cve-2020-14979-local-privilege-escalation-in-evga-precisionx1-cf63c6b95896 2) CVE Database, https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2020-14979 3) Related Github issue, https://github.com/LibreHardwareMonitor/LibreHardwareMonitor/issues/984 4) Fan Control Dev, https://www.reddit.com/r/JayzTwoCents/comments/13nwpzq/comment/jldj1o9/ Feel free to ask questions, there's no such thing as a stupid question on my posts.",
    "clean_comments": [
      "Level 0: It's not true that EVGA was anyhow involved in the WinRing0 driver. They were just one of many companies that used it as it was easy to integrate it and open-source. And the driver+signature was accepted by Windows kernel because it used the old (attestation / cross-certified) signing method that was sufficient several years ago and didn't require an expensive EV code-signing certificate. Signing requirements for kernel drivers changed after Win10 release but drivers signed before were still accepted to preserve compatibility. No one had to convince MS to accept that driver, you just bough a certificate for Windows kernel code signing (with MS cross-cert), signed your driver and it worked. The author of WinRing0 had such certificate probably also for other projects he was working on. Today, you need a more expensive EV certificate (issued to businesses only) and need to let MS sign your driver on their portal (validated via customer EV cert).",

    "clean_text": "Lessons from Next.js Middleware vulnerability CVE-2025-29927: Why Route-Level Auth Checks Are Worth the Extra Work Hey r/nextjs community, With the recent disclosure of CVE-2025-29927 (the Next.js middleware bypass vulnerability), I wanted to share some thoughts on an authentication patterns that I always use in all my projects and that can help keep your apps secure, even in the face of framework-level vulnerabilities like this. For those who haven't heard, Vercel recently disclosed a critical vulnerability in Next.js middleware. By adding a special header (`x-middleware-subrequest`) to requests, attackers can completely bypass middleware-based authentication checks. This affects apps that rely on middleware for auth or security checks without additional validation at the route level. We can all agree that middleware-based auth is convenient (implement once, protect many routes), this vulnerability highlights why checking auth at the route level provides an additional layer of security. Yes, it's more verbose and requires more code, but it creates a defense-in-depth approach that's resilient to middleware bypasses. Here's a pattern I've been using, some people always ask why I don't just use the middleware, but that incident proves its effectiveness. **First, create a¬†requireAuth¬†function:** export async function requireAuth(Roles: Role[] = []) { const session = await auth(); if (!session) { return redirect('/signin'); } if (Roles.length && !userHasRoles(session.user, Roles)) { return { authorized: false, session }; } return { authorized: true, session }; } // Helper function to check roles function userHasRoles(user: Session[\"user\"], roles: Role[]) { const userRoles = user?.roles || []; const userRolesName = userRoles.map((role) => role.role.name); return roles.every((role) => userRolesName.includes(role)); } **Then, implement it in every route that needs protection:** export default async function AdminPage() { const { authorized } = await requireAuth([Role.ADMIN]); if (!authorized) return <Unauthorized />; // Your protected page content return ( <div> <h1>Admin Dashboard</h1> {/* Rest of your protected content */} </div> ); } # Benefits of This Approach 1. **Resilience to middleware vulnerabilities**: Even if middleware is bypassed, each route still performs its own auth check 2. **Fine-grained control**: Different routes can require different roles or permissions 3. **Explicit security**: Makes the security requirements of each route clear in the code 4. **Early returns**: Auth failures are handled before any sensitive logic executes I use [Next.js Full-Stack-Kit](https://full-stack-kit.dev) for several projects and it implements this pattern consistently across all protected routes. What I like about that pattern is that auth checks aren't hidden away in some middleware config - they're right there at the top of each page component, making the security requirements explicit and reviewable. At first, It might seem tedious to add auth checks to every route (especially when you have dozens of them), this vulnerability shows why that extra work is worth it. Defense in depth is a fundamental security principle, and implementing auth checks at multiple levels can save you from framework-level vulnerabilities. Stay safe guys!",
    "clean_comments": [
      "Level 0: Authorisation checks should be done as high and early as reasonable. If it's simple condition like signin status or role and same rule would be applied to whole segment anyway, there's no need to spread it to each child route. Also you'd avoid more expensive RSC execution in case a redirect is necessary. If the check is more granular e.g. \"....where id=? and foo.owner=?\", 123, user.id)\" then it needs to be done at data access layer obviously. Doing **authentication** in middleware or equivalent concept is another thing. Since it will be done anyway, might as well handle it right away. This would also make standardized auth solutions easier when the whole authentication process could be a preliminary step, establishing the internal user data as result.",
      "Level 1: Would you then say that authorization should be done at the highest level route that needs to be protected through something like a template.tsx?",
      "Level 1: What are your thoughts on the potential performance implications of auth checks in middleware? I‚Äôm not the sort of dev who typically obsesses much about perf, but this scenario is one exception. My understanding (correct me if I‚Äôm wrong) is that for a typical app with a partially personalised UI - e.g. a dashboard with the user‚Äôs avatar in the top-right - most of the outer app ‚Äúshell‚Äù is static (i.e. the same thing is shown to all users). In this case, it feels wrong to me to dump a blocking auth service check in middleware. Instead, you could conceivably render parts of the screen immediately and then any slower, user-specific elements stream in and replace their skeleton loaders. Additionally, you only need to do a single db/auth service hit to verify a user, as this result can then just use React‚Äôs cache function to reuse the result across the same server render pass. One final pattern I‚Äôve been using is ‚Äúoptimistic‚Äù session checks in middleware, which is basically instant as it only checks for a JWT. Of course it‚Äôs technically not secure because it could be tampered with, but for rendering basic user data there‚Äôs no issue. And for operations that really need full server security, you use row-level security, auth guards in RSCs, server actions, etc. In this way, you get immediate UI rendering with secure data access (it‚Äôs just a bit more cumbersome than having a single middleware check). I think seb markbage supports this pattern from one of his tweets. Also could be a motivating factor for features like partial pre-rendering",
      "Level 2: Parsing and validating JWT token ( let's say HS256) takes ~5-20 microseconds. Asymmetric ones will be slower but even if it would take 1ms you are completely fine for blocking for 1ms in any typical web application. Sessions make much less sense for distributed system but if you're close to db it's perfectly viable. Usually it's just a single index lookup which should be very fast. Again shouldn't be an issue. Most framework default to doing this every request and it isn't an issue. Why this is an issue with NextJS? Because middleware runs possibly 10000km away from the data. Also people do crazy things like calling an external server ( Supabase for example) to do the auth check which obviously is extremely slow. My advice? Use JWT and just validate it locally. Extremely fast and simple."

      "Level 0: What‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs thoughts on passkeys these days? The root cause of this CVE is that the authenticator (your BLE security key) has no built-in mechanism to independently verify the authenticity of the host (domain) it‚Äôs communicating with. This absence of ‚Äúhost verification‚Äù allows attackers to MITM the BLE-based authentication, redirecting legitimate responses to malicious endpoints. Cool. So your fancy BLE security key basically trusts whoever it connects with over Bluetooth, without ever double-checking who‚Äôs on the other end. Oops. Not an easy fix, but clearly authenticators need a way to explicitly verify the domain before signing responses. Without domain validation PassKeys are vulnerable to subtle but powerful MITM attacks like this one. As far as mitigations I can think of a few: BLE Domain Binding: Enhance the security of BLE keys by incorporating explicit domain checks directly into the BLE handshake. This would ensure that the authenticator independently verifies the host‚Äôs identity, preventing unauthorized access from third-party devices. Out-of-Band Domain Checks: Implement a secondary, trusted channel (such as NFC or a ‚Äútap-to-confirm‚Äù feature on the security device) to validate the domain requesting PassKey credentials. This would provide an additional layer of verification before the device trusts the request without hesitation. Challenge-Based Verification: Have the authenticator issue a cryptographic challenge specifically tied to the domain. The authenticator won‚Äôt finalize the authentication unless the host proves its legitimacy cryptographically. In other words, make the domain prove it‚Äôs not an imposter first.",
      "Level 1: It‚Äôs a new technology that hasn‚Äôt been battle tested. Adopt if you wanna beta test for free. Personally, this is just device authentication cookies dressed in their Sunday best. I‚Äôm not a fan and will continue to ignore prompts to use them.",
      "Level 2: To me they seem to basically give everyone a yubikey. Which we've seen as being superior to token 2FA. I think Passkeys a great. Much harder to Phish."

The CVSS score is 9.9 representing a serious risk, however this impacts only AD Domain-joined backup servers. The attack takes advantage of a deserialization vulnerability in two different .NET classes. Deserialization is a process to reassemble data after it has been broken into smaller pieces in a stream of bytes known as serialization. The vendor, watchTowr, who reported the vulnerability to Veeam, made note to mention the process of relying on deny-lists, instead of accept-lists is one of the root causes, as it allows attackers to attempt to identify other classes which are not blocked to facilitate code execution. As Sophos has previously reported\\[1\\], Veeam backup servers are frequently targeted by financially motivated threat actors to encrypt and ransom an organization‚Äôs data.

These are serious ‚Äî with a CVSS v3.1 base score of **9.8**, and they allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the cluster‚Äôs Ingress NGINX Controller pod and potentially access *all secrets across all namespaces*. If you‚Äôre running Kubernetes in production, please read on. **TL;DR** * **Vulnerabilities:** CVE-2025-1097, CVE-2025-1098, CVE-2025-24514, CVE-2025-1974 * **Severity:** Critical (9.8 CVSS v3.1) * **Potential Impact:** Full cluster takeover (access to all secrets in the cluster). * **Affected Component:** Admission controller inside Ingress NGINX (a very commonly used ingress controller). **Summary** Ingress NGINX Controller is massively popular. Wiz says they‚Äôve found **over 6,500** publicly exposed clusters ‚Äì including some at Fortune 500 companies ‚Äì that have the admission controller wide open to the internet, making them critical targets. Ingress NGINX by default deploys a validating webhook (admission controller) that checks incoming ingress objects for compliance. But in these vulnerable versions, that webhook can be abused to inject malicious NGINX configs. That eventually leads to RCE within the Ingress NGINX pod. Combine that with the admission controller‚Äôs elevated privileges, and it‚Äôs game over. **Affected Versions / Fix** * **Fixed in:** Ingress NGINX Controller versions `1.12.1` and `1.11.5`. * If you‚Äôre running an older release, you‚Äôre at risk. Patch ASAP. **Mitigation Steps** 1. **Update** to the latest Ingress NGINX Controller (1.12.1+ or 1.11.5+). 2. **Lock down the admission webhook** so it‚Äôs only reachable by the Kubernetes API Server. * This means restricting network policies or ensuring the webhook isn‚Äôt publicly exposed. 3. **If you can‚Äôt patch**, you can: * Temporarily **disable** the validating webhook by removing the `ingress-nginx-admission` ValidatingWebhookConfiguration and the `--validating-webhook` argument. (But remember: re-enable it once you upgrade, because it does serve useful security checks!) * Apply **strict network policies** so only the K8s control plane can talk to this webhook.",

    "clean_text": "Critical Vulnerability: CrushFTP CVE-2025-31161 Auth Bypass and Post-Exploitation **TL;DR:** CVE-2025-31161 is a critical severity vulnerability allowing attackers to control how user authentication is handled by CrushFTP managed file transfer (MFT) software. **We strongly recommend patching immediately to avoid affected versions 10.0.0 through 10.8.3 and 11.0.0 through 11.3.0.** Successful exploitation of CVE-2025-31161 would give attackers admin level access across the CrushFTP application for further compromise. On 3 April 2025, Huntress observed in-the-wild exploitation of CVE-2025-31161, an authentication bypass vulnerability in versions of the CrushFTP software. We uncovered further post-exploitation activity leveraging the MeshCentral agent and other malware that we will discuss in [this writeup.¬†](https://www.huntress.com/blog/crushftp-cve-2025-31161-auth-bypass-and-post-exploitation?utm_campaign=rapid-response&utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social) While doing some further analysis, we uncovered potential evidence of compromise as early as 30 March 2025, which seemed to be testing access, and did not spawn any external processes to CrushFTP. In¬†[a recent post](https://x.com/Shadowserver/status/1906753539499520064)¬†from the ShadowServer team, they state as of March 30 there were¬†[\\~1,500 vulnerable instances](https://dashboard.shadowserver.org/statistics/honeypot/vulnerability/time-series/?date_range=7&host_type=src&vendor=crushftp&vulnerability=cve-2025-2825&dataset=unique_ips&limit=1000&group_by=geo&style=stacked)¬†of CrushFTP publicly exposed to the internet. We have published a proof of concept, IOCs, and analysis on Mesh and AnyDesk post exploitations [in this blog](https://www.huntress.com/blog/crushftp-cve-2025-31161-auth-bypass-and-post-exploitation?utm_campaign=rapid-response&utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social). # What is CVE-2025-31161? [CVE-2025-31161](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-31161)¬†is a¬†**9.8 CVSS**¬†critical severity vulnerability that affects how the CrushFTP file transfer application handles user authentication. At the time of writing, the NIST NVD entry states the description: *CrushFTP versions 10.0.0 through 10.8.3 and 11.0.0 through 11.3.0 are affected by a vulnerability in the S3 authorization header processing that allows authentication bypass. Remote and unauthenticated HTTP requests to CrushFTP with known usernames can be used to impersonate a user and conduct actions on their behalf, including administrative actions and data retrieval.* This vulnerability¬†[is patched](https://www.crushftp.com/crush11wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=Update)¬†and is mitigated in CrushFTP versions 11.3.1+ and 10.8.4+. Huntress has validated and confirmed the authentication bypass is prevented in patched versions. Please ensure your own installations of CrushFTP are updated to the latest versions. If your CrushFTP instance is publicly exposed to the open Internet,¬†**we strongly recommend you patch immediately.** Upon successful exploitation, an adversary may gain access to the administrator user account for the CrushFTP application, and leverage this to create new backdoor accounts, access files (upload and download), obtain code execution, and achieve full control of the vulnerable server. The vulnerability was assigned a CVE on March 26, and the Shadowserver Foundation first reported CVE-2025-31161 exploitation activity on March 31. The exploitation of CVE-2025-31161 is indicative of a concerning trend that we‚Äôve seen¬†[across several incidents](https://www.huntress.com/blog/threat-advisory-oh-no-cleo-cleo-software-actively-being-exploited-in-the-wild), where threat actors are targeting MFT platforms as a way to deliver disruptive attacks. These platforms are typically external-facing and house sensitive enterprise data, making them a favorite for threat actors. As such, prompt patching is critical. Within our partner base we have seen 148 unique endpoints with the CrushFTP software installed as a service, with 95 of these running major versions 10 and 11.¬† Approximately 72 different companies within our customer base were currently running unpatched versions of CrushFTP.¬†¬†**Customers have been notified of the urgency to upgrade.** Numerous other security firms have discussed CVE-2025-31161 (hat tip to¬†[Rapid7 AttackerKB](https://attackerkb.com/topics/k0EgiL9Psz/cve-2025-2825/rapid7-analysis)¬†and¬†[Outpost24](https://outpost24.com/blog/crushftp-auth-bypass-vulnerability/)¬†amongst others) and thanks to their shared insights, Huntress was able to recreate a proof-of-concept (PoC) with ease. The core of this vulnerability is the S3 authentication functionality included as a part of CrushFTP. Due to logic bugs in the underlying source code (which¬†[Project Discovery did a fantastic job](https://projectdiscovery.io/blog/crushftp-authentication-bypass)¬†outlining), a mere¬†**Authorization**¬†header in an HTTP request is all that is needed to bypass authentication without valid username or password credentials. # What is Huntress Doing? Post-exploitation efforts are already thoroughly covered by Huntress detection rules. In response to these intrusions specifically, [we crafted detectors to find child processes invoked underneath the CrushFTP service executable](https://gist.github.com/JohnHammond/a22bf3103eeb0f985cf1cef4d3fc849f#file-win_proc_creation_shell_child_process_crushftp-yml).

Since Next.js is open-source, they reviewed the code, identified the issue, and the rest is history.

      "Level 0: This is my interpretation of the entire thing (subject to potential error) as I've not seen a lot of discussion around it, outside of a few threads on the SCCM reddit. The update doesn't change what files were signed with the cert (at the time) when you first built the device. You need to make this change. [How to manage the Windows Boot Manager revocations for Secure Boot changes associated with CVE-2023-24932 - Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/topic/how-to-manage-the-windows-boot-manager-revocations-for-secure-boot-changes-associated-with-cve-2023-24932-41a975df-beb2-40c1-99a3-b3ff139f832d#bkmk_scopeofimpact) Scroll down to mitigation deployment guidelines and it tells you what to do there which, doing this for 1500 machines will take you ages, so an alternative way; I tried updating our winPE addon as we use SCCM but despite following their instructions, it still shows the old cert though unless i've done something wrong, if anyone else has managed to get the new cert showing for their PE addon, please post and save me. [WinPE: Mount and Customize | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/winpe-mount-and-customize?view=windows-11#add-updates-to-winpe-if-needed) and step 6 here; [WinPE: Create bootable media | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/winpe-create-usb-bootable-drive?view=windows-11#update-the-windows-pe-add-on-for-the-windows-adk) if it was at least in the image, thats half of it effectively done (not including the reimaging your devices part) and you just have to enable the revocation part via registry which you could do with group policy. The idea was in my situation, to include this update whilst we're reimaging devices which over time would cover a fair chunk and then manually do the rest. But no dice.

Had updated AMD Chipset Driver to 7.01.08.129 before and after the F5 BIOS update. Got random 4d error on boot up, stuck on the screen with Aorus logo without the spinning wheel. Tried reset BIOS to default settings, no help. Tried turning off PSU then hold power button for 30 secs, no good. Redownload and reflash F5 bios again then turn off memory restore context. Things seems to work well. On boot up the next day, remember I haven't turn on secure boot after reflashing BIOS. Turn it back on and the random 4d boot up error start happening again. Afterwards, I noticed some of the BIOS settings was changed after secure boot changes, including memory context restore changing back to auto. Turned it off, thought everything was stable. Turned on my PC the next day and it got stuck with 4d error again. Seems like there's something wrong with secure boot or the way I turned it on. User standard/custom mode both causes 4d error randomly. But when it boot successfully, everything works fine. Did a quick 30 min CPU+RAM and RAM test via OCCT and nothing was found.

    "clean_text": "Nvidia Patch Incompleteness Poses Risks in AI Container Security **Trend Micro has discovered a critical security flaw in Nvidia's patch for the Container Toolkit that still leaves AI environments vulnerable to attacks.** **Key Points:** - Trend Micro flags Nvidia's incomplete patch for a critical vulnerability. - The flaw allows potential container escape attacks and unauthorized access. - Organizations using Nvidia's toolkit are directly at risk, especially with default settings. - The patch doesn't properly enforce checks against race conditions, allowing exploitation. - A denial-of-service flaw has also been identified affecting Docker on Linux systems. Trend Micro researchers have flagged significant issues with Nvidia's patching of a critical vulnerability found in the Nvidia Container Toolkit, originally addressed last September. The vulnerability, identified as CVE-2024-0132, scored an alarming 9 out of 10 on the CVSS scale, categorizing it as high priority. However, Trend Micro's findings indicate that the patch is not fully effective, leaving enterprises exposed to dangerous container escape attacks. Such vulnerabilities enable hackers to execute arbitrary commands and access sensitive data, putting organizations' proprietary information at significant risk. The security gap lies in the incomplete enforcement of checks that would typically prevent exploitation via the time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition. This flaw allows a crafted container to maneuver past isolation barriers and manipulate host resources. The potential fallout from such exploitation includes theft of sensitive information, prolonged system downtime, and substantial operational disruptions. Organizations relying on the Nvidia Container Toolkit for their AI workloads and Docker environments must be aware of these risks, particularly those operating with default configurations or the newer features of the toolkit. Additionally, alongside this vulnerability, Trend Micro has pointed out a related denial-of-service issue specifically affecting Docker configurations on Linux systems. Containers using specific mount options can lead to unchecked growth in the Linux mount table, creating a service disruption that can hinder remote access and overall operation. To mitigate these threats, Trend Micro advocates for stricter access controls and the disabling of unnecessary features within the Nvidia toolkit. How are organizations adapting their security strategies in light of this Nvidia vulnerability? **Learn More:** [Security Week](https://www.securityweek.com/trend-micro-flags-incomplete-nvidia-patch-that-leaves-ai-containers-exposed/) **Want to stay updated on the latest cyber threats?** üëâ **[Subscribe to /r/PwnHub](https://www.reddit.com/r/pwnhub)**",

Blickt man weiter ins Jahr 2035, d√ºrfte dieser Anteil in den USA bereits bei nahezu 100 Prozent der 290 Millionen Fahrzeuge liegen. Auch China zieht nach: Dort sollen bis dahin rund 72 Prozent der 350 Millionen Autos als Connected Cars unterwegs sein. Damit ist die Mehrheit der Fahrzeuge in diesen L√§ndern bereits vernetzt, Tendenz steigend. Dies bringt jedoch nicht nur Fortschritt und Komfort, sondern √∂ffnet auch neue Angriffsm√∂glichkeiten f√ºr Kriminelle. Mit der zunehmenden Vernetzung der Fahrzeuge steigt das Risiko von Cyberangriffen, die von Datendiebstahl bis hin zur Manipulation von Fahrfunktionen reichen k√∂nnen. # √úber Bluetooth eingehackt Inwieweit sich tats√§chlich sensible Fahrfunktionen kapern lassen, haben IT-Sicherheitsexperten von PCAutomotive auf der Hackerkonferenz Black Hat Asia 2025 demonstriert. F√ºr ihre Pr√§sentation verwendeten sie einen Nissan Leaf der zweiten Generation, Baujahr 2020. Dabei erfolgte der Angriff durch ein Einfallstor in der Bluetooth-Schnittstelle des Elektroautos. Schwachstellen im Infotainmentsystem erm√∂glichten dar√ºber hinaus eine Rechteerweiterung und schlie√ülich einen verdeckten Fernzugriff √ºber die Mobilfunkverbindung. # Dramatische Folgen f√ºr die Sicherheit der Insassen Die Folgen einer solchen Schwachstelle k√∂nnten kaum gravierender sein. Angreifer k√∂nnen den Standort des Fahrzeugs verfolgen und Inhalte des Infotainment-Bildschirms manipulieren oder mit Screenshots speichern. Gespr√§che k√∂nnen heimlich aufgezeichnet und sogar √ºber den Lautsprecher des Autos wiedergegeben werden. Es kommt aber noch schlimmer: Auch physische Funktionen des Kraftfahrzeuges wie T√ºren, Scheibenwischer, Spiegel, Fenster und auch Leuchten k√∂nnen nach der Hacker-√úbernahme sowohl aus dem Stand als auch w√§hrend der Fahrt ferngesteuert werden. Sogar die Lenkung des Fahrzeugs soll laut [netzwelt.de](http://netzwelt.de) aus der Ferne manipulierbar sein ‚Äì der Albtraum eines jeden Autofahrers. Was einst nach d√ºsterer Science-Fiction klang, ist heute eine reale und ernstzunehmende Bedrohung. # Cyberangriffe werden immer noch untersch√§tzt Laut der Pr√§sentation von PCAutomotive sind die Cyberexperten auf insgesamt zehn Sicherheitsl√ºcken gesto√üen. Diese sind mittlerweile unter den Codes PCA\\_NISSAN\\_009, PCA\\_NISSAN\\_012 und CVE-2025-32056 bis CVE-2025-32063 bekannt. Die Meldung an Nissan erfolgte bereits im August 2023. Dennoch h√§tten die Gegenma√ünahmen seitens des japanischen Autoherstellers viel Zeit in Anspruch genommen. Details will man bei Nissan aus Sicherheitsgr√ºnden nicht preisgeben. Vielleicht aber auch aus Kalk√ºl ‚Äì denn die Hersteller tun noch immer zu wenig gegen Cyberangriffe. Immer wieder werden neue Schwachstellen bei verschiedenen Marken und Modellen bekannt. Allerdings sind nicht nur die Autobauer Schuld: Cybersicherheit kostet bares Geld und setzt man die Kundenbrille auf, handelt es sich um eine Verbesserung, die man schlicht nicht sehen kann. # Bu√ügeldvorw√ºrfe stets √ºber [Geblitzt.de](http://Geblitzt.de) pr√ºfen lassen Bei [Geblitzt.de](http://Geblitzt.de) arbeitet die CODUKA GmbH eng mit gro√üen Anwaltskanzleien zusammen und erm√∂glicht es Betroffenen, sich gegen Bu√ügelder, Punkte und Fahrverbote zu wehren.

    "clean_text": "Critical Apache Roller Insufficient Session Expiration on Password Change Vulnerability CVE-2025-24859 A session management vulnerability exists in Apache Roller before version 6.1.5 where active user sessions are not properly invalidated after password changes. When a user's password is changed, either by the user themselves or by an administrator, existing sessions remain active and usable. This allows continued access to the application through old sessions even after password changes, potentially enabling unauthorized access if credentials were compromised. This issue affects Apache Roller versions up to and including 6.1.4. The vulnerability is fixed in Apache Roller 6.1.5 by implementing centralized session management that properly invalidates all active sessions when passwords are changed or users are disabled.

Windows 10 and 11 users have recently noticed a seemingly empty directory called 'inetpub' appearing on their systems after installing Microsoft's April 2025 Patch Tuesday updates. While many users may see this folder as unnecessary and consider deleting it, Microsoft has explicitly warned against such action, clarifying that it plays a critical role in protecting systems from exploitation of a newly patched vulnerability, CVE-2025-21204. This vulnerability poses a serious risk as it allows unauthorized users to potentially gain system-level access, posing a significant threat to the integrity of a user's system. The inetpub folder is typically associated with Microsoft's Internet Information Services (IIS) web server software. However, even users without IIS installed are affected by this change. The folder is created with specific read-only SYSTEM-level permissions, which enhances security measures against potential privilege escalation attempts. Microsoft reassures users that there is currently no evidence of active exploitation regarding CVE-2025-21204, but maintaining the folder's integrity is key to preventing future security risks. Thus, rather than being a cause for alarm, the folder signifies a proactive step by Microsoft in safeguarding Windows systems.

MITRE warned of \"multiple impacts to CVE, including deterioration of national vulnerability databases and advisories, tool vendors, incident response operations, and all manner of critical infrastructure.\" This development threatened the continuity of a foundational element in global cybersecurity infrastructure. In a last-minute intervention, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) extended funding and awarded an 11-month bridge contract to ensure there would be no lapse in CVE services. https://preview.redd.it/lbyeumybt9ve1.png?width=375&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb7f0728ef1ca829568cdf3a1255c5d8ebce97e7 # Understanding the CVE Program The CVE program, established in 1999 and managed by MITRE, provides a standardized system for identifying and cataloging publicly known cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Each vulnerability is assigned a unique identifier (e.g., CVE-2025-12345), facilitating consistent communication among security professionals, vendors and organizations worldwide. CVE records are categorized based on the type of vulnerability, affected software or hardware, and potential impact. These records typically include a brief description, references to public advisories or patches, and severity ratings, when available. The lifecycle of a CVE follows a structured process: 1. **Discovery**¬†‚Äì A researcher, vendor or organization identifies a potential security flaw. 2. **Submission**¬†‚Äì The issue is reported to a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA), which validates and assigns a CVE ID. 3. **Disclosure**¬†‚Äì After validation, the vulnerability is publicly disclosed either by the discoverer or the CNA, depending on coordination. 4. **Publication**¬†‚Äì The CVE entry is published to the CVE List and made available to the community for integration into tools and databases. 5. **Ongoing Maintenance**¬†‚Äì MITRE and CNAs monitor for corrections, updates and additional reference material to keep the records accurate and useful. The CVE program serves as a backbone for security tools and frameworks such as the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), which augments CVE records with CVSS scores and metadata, and the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE), which categorizes the underlying flaw types. By offering a centralized, transparent, and community-driven system, the CVE program supports timely vulnerability management and helps coordinate global response efforts. # Importance of the CVE program The CVE program is foundational to global cybersecurity efforts for several reasons: * **Standardization:**¬†It offers a common language for describing vulnerabilities, enabling effective collaboration across different organizations and sectors.‚Äã * **Integration:**¬†Many security tools and processes rely on CVE identifiers to function correctly, including vulnerability scanners, patch management systems and threat intelligence platforms. * **Coordination:**¬†The program supports coordinated vulnerability disclosure, allowing vendors and researchers to manage and communicate about security issues efficiently.‚Äã Without the CVE system, the cybersecurity community would face challenges in tracking, prioritizing and mitigating vulnerabilities, leading to increased risks and potential exploitation by threat actors. # Implications for the cybersecurity industry The potential lapse in CVE program funding raised several concerns:‚Äã * **Operational disruption:**¬†A halt in CVE assignments could disrupt security vendors, security teams such as Incident responders and many others, as organizations would lack standardized identifiers for new vulnerabilities.‚Äã * **Increased risk:**¬†Delayed vulnerability identification and remediation efforts could expose systems to prolonged periods of risk.‚Äã * **Fragmentation:**¬†In the absence of a centralized system, disparate methods for tracking vulnerabilities might emerge, leading to inconsistencies and confusion.‚Äã These challenges underscore the critical role of the CVE program in maintaining cybersecurity resilience across industries and national infrastructures. # Strategic response and recommendations To ensure the sustainability and effectiveness of the CVE program, the following measures are recommended: **1. Diversify funding sources** Engage stakeholders from the private sector, international partners and non-profit organizations to contribute to the program's funding, reducing reliance on a single government entity.‚Äã **2. Establish independent governance** The formation of the CVE Foundation aims to provide a neutral, community-driven governance structure, enhancing the program's resilience and global trust.‚Äã **3. Enhance transparency** Regular communication about the program's status, funding and strategic direction can build confidence among users and contributors.‚Äã **4. Invest in automation** Leveraging automation and artificial intelligence can improve the efficiency of vulnerability identification and management processes.‚Äã **5. Strengthen international collaboration** Foster partnerships with international cybersecurity organizations to ensure a unified approach to vulnerability management and to share best practices. # European Union's proactive measures In response to the evolving cybersecurity landscape, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) has launched the European Vulnerability Database ([EUVD](https://euvd.enisa.europa.eu/)). This initiative embraces a multi-stakeholder approach by collecting publicly available vulnerability information from multiple sources, including Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs), vendors and existing databases. The EUVD aims to enhance transparency and efficiency in vulnerability management across the EU. # Ensuring resilience and sustainability moving forward The recent funding crisis of the CVE program highlights the fragility of essential cybersecurity infrastructures. While immediate disruptions have been averted, it is imperative for the global cybersecurity community to take proactive steps to ensure the resilience and sustainability of vulnerability management systems. Collaborative efforts, diversified funding and international cooperation will be key to safeguarding our digital ecosystems. **References:** * [MITRE Signals Potential CVE Program Deterioration as US Gov Funding Expires](https://www.securityweek.com/mitre-signals-potential-cve-program-deterioration-as-us-gov-funding-expires/) * [CISA Extends Funding to Ensure No Lapse in Critical CVE Services](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cisa-extends-funding-to-ensure-no-lapse-in-critical-cve-services/) * [Funding Expires for Key Cyber Vulnerability Database](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/04/funding-expires-for-key-cyber-vulnerability-database/) * [CVE Program Funding Expires‚ÄîWhat It Means And What To Do Next](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateoflahertyuk/2025/04/16/cve-program-funding-cut-what-it-means-and-what-to-do-next/) * [Another Step Forward Towards Responsible Vulnerability Disclosure in Europe](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/another-step-forward-towards-responsible-vulnerability-disclosure-in-europe) * [ENISA Vulnerability Disclosure](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/vulnerability-disclosure) https://preview.redd.it/1b9m9b9wt9ve1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7f84681c373eba979a9445cd792f306028c76ea3 [This article originally appeared on the Barracuda Blog.](https://blog.barracuda.com/2025/04/16/cve-program-funding-crisis) [Adam Khan](https://blog.barracuda.com/author/adam-khan) Adam Khan is the VP, Global Security Operations at Barracuda MSP.

The vulnerability identified in SonicWall's Secure Mobile Access (SMA) appliances, particularly in models SMA 200, 210, 400, 410, and 500v, poses a significant threat to organizations that utilize these devices for secure remote access. Originally classified as a medium severity denial-of-service vulnerability, the flaw has been reclassified to high severity due to its potential for remote code execution, which could allow malicious actors to execute arbitrary commands with limited privileges. This change underscores the urgency for affected organizations to act swiftly to mitigate risk. Cybersecurity analysts, including Arctic Wolf, have tracked the exploitation of this vulnerability since January 2025. The exploitation involves leveraging a default admin account that is widely considered insecure, which casts further doubt on the security practices of organizations using these devices. SonicWall has advised immediate action, including limiting VPN access, deactivating unnecessary accounts, enabling multi-factor authentication, and resetting all local account passwords to prevent potential breaches. Furthermore, the inclusion of this vulnerability in the CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog signals its severe implications for national security and the broad necessity for organizations to update their security measures.

The recently identified CVE-2025-24054 vulnerability in Microsoft Windows poses a significant risk by allowing unauthorized attackers to spoof NTLM credentials across networks. NTLM is an outdated authentication protocol that has been largely deprecated in favor of newer technologies like Kerberos. However, its continued presence in Windows environments presents an enduring target for cybercriminals. This flaw can be triggered with minimal user interaction, such as a simple click or file inspection, illustrating how effortless it is for attackers to exploit it. Once activated, it can lead to the extraction of NTLM hashes, which can be further leveraged in malicious campaigns to compromise systems. Following the initial reports of exploitation, cybersecurity firms identified numerous campaigns, particularly targeting government and private institutions in regions like Poland and Romania. Attackers have been observed distributing malicious links via emails, using trusted cloud storage platforms to evade detection. As these malicious .library-ms files take advantage of a ZIP archive format, they facilitate an SMB authentication request, enabling hash leaks with no direct execution of the files required. This seamless method of infiltration showcases the urgency for organizations to patch these vulnerabilities promptly and address the risks associated with NTLM to safeguard their networks against credential theft and further attacks. How can organizations better protect themselves against vulnerabilities like CVE-2025-24054 in their networks? **Learn More:** [The Hacker News](https://thehackernews.com/2025/04/cve-2025-24054-under-active.html) **Want to stay updated on the latest cyber threats?** üëâ **[Subscribe to /r/PwnHub](https://www.reddit.com/r/pwnhub)**",
