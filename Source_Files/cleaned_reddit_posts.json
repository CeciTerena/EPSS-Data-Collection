    "clean_text": "Why does Defender hate Fan Control? An explanation of Windows Drivers, WinRing0.sys, and its 7.8 CVE score: #TL;DR Windows Defender is not wrong, per se. `WinRing0` DOES has a vulnerability that lets unprivileged programs hack into Windows. * Fan Control is not malicious, WinRing0 is not malicious, but a malicious program can use WinRing0 to bypass your system's security measures because it has a vulnerability. * Read source 1 for the technical details. * You don't have to read this entire wall of text, skip to the headers that interests you. Introduction Hello everyone! As you probably found out by now, Fan Control's implementation is currently broken. This is due to the kernel driver that Fan Control uses WinRing0 being blocked by Windows Defender. I want to clarify a few things I learned while researching this and show a bit of behind the scenes of how your computer talks to Fan Control and why Defender has blocked it. Pet Peeve First off, as a computer scientist it pains me to see people's knee jerk reaction is to override their operating system's security systems. It's there to protect you, yes it can make mistakes, but you should generally wait for an official response or similar understanding and you shouldn't do it blindly. Your security means nothing if you override your security when it's inconvenient. It's kind of like taking the carbon monoxide alarm off the wall because you don't like that it's beeping super loudly. Anyways. What is a driver and why do we need them? ^(skip to next header if you don't care how drivers work) To answer why Defender has blocked fan Control, I first have to explain how Fan Control works with Windows. I'll try to keep this explanation as simple as possible. *^(Asterisks indicate an oversimplification for clarity) Window's main job is to manage a bunch of different applications and allow them to talk to the hardware. In old times it used to be the case that a program can tell the computer to do whatever it wants. This was a problem because it could mess up other programs, crash the entire system, and do malicious things. So to fix this, operating systems (OS) now split up the computer's memory and give a piece to each application. This application now has its own space to do things, called user-space. Each application is *only allowed to do things in its own piece of memory and nothing else. If the application crashed, the OS can throw away the application & its piece of memory and everything else on the system will be fine. This has a big problem though: applications isolated in user-space could not talk to hardware! If you can talk to the hardware, you can do anything to the system, so it's an intentional protection. But your hardware needs to talk to the operating system to work, but there is too many pieces of hardware that all work differently. Windows doesn't know how to talk to all of them! So we need these programs that can interface with hardware but can't live in user-space. But at the same time we want the kind of protection that user-space gives. The solution is drivers: special programs that can receive special exceptions to live in *kernel-space. Kernel-space is the opposite of user-space. You can do anything in kernel-space! Like talk to hardware to control your fans or read your credit card number when you pay for something. Because kernel-space drivers are so high risk Microsoft gate keeps them with an iron fist, kinda like Apple's non-EU app store on iPhones. Fan Control used a driver called WinRing0 Fan Control cannot talk directly to your hardware. It can talk to a driver, and that driver can talk to the hardware. There are a few different drivers and api's Fan Control uses, but the main one was WinRing0. Who made WinRing0? WinRing0 is a third party driver developed by OpenLibSys. Who convinced Microsoft to let WinRing0 be a driver with privileges? The company called EVGA convinced Microsoft. Why? Because EVGA made software that used the third party driver. They don't use it anymore because it was vulnerable. WinRing0 is a vulnerable driver! This is why Defender hates WinRing0. On August 11th, 2020 a security researcher named Matt Hand published¹ the vulnerability report for WinRing0 proving that it had a high-risk privilege escalation exploit. This means a user-space program can take control of this driver* and then use it to gain kernel-space privileges. This means a lowly application can take advantage of WinRing0 to do whatever it wants to your computer! When this was discovered, EVGA abandoned WinRing0 and made their own proprietary driver that they use. The developers of WinRing0 can fix the driver, but under Microsoft's modern strict driver rules, an updated WinRing0 won't make it past Microsoft's driver gate keepers. Many projects used and still use this driver. That's why Microsoft couldn't just cut support outright for the driver- too many things would break all at once. But WinRing0 was on borrowed time, Microsoft planned to cut the driver in 2024, but then they pushed it back to Jan 2025. And now Microsoft seems to start following through. What are the risks of running a vulnerable driver? Well a vulnerable driver is basically a front door to your house that you cannot lock. If everyone in town is friendly, you're good. But all it takes is one malicious actor to recognize the vulnerable door and waltz right on in. The door still functions, and friendly programs like Fan Control are respectful when they have to go in your house through the door. But you are less protected while having it installed. I would recommend listening to Defender. If you choose to override Defender, know that your OS's front door is open, and any program you run can use it for whatever they wish.

    "clean_comments": [
      "Level 0: It's not true that EVGA was anyhow involved in the WinRing0 driver. They were just one of many companies that used it as it was easy to integrate it and open-source. And the driver+signature was accepted by Windows kernel because it used the old (attestation / cross-certified) signing method that was sufficient several years ago and didn't require an expensive EV code-signing certificate. Signing requirements for kernel drivers changed after Win10 release but drivers signed before were still accepted to preserve compatibility. No one had to convince MS to accept that driver, you just bough a certificate for Windows kernel code signing (with MS cross-cert), signed your driver and it worked. The author of WinRing0 had such certificate probably also for other projects he was working on. Today, you need a more expensive EV certificate (issued to businesses only) and need to let MS sign your driver on their portal (validated via customer EV cert).",

Literalmente enviar o seguinte header: x-middleware-subrequest: middleware permite acesso, como usuário logado, aos sites que utilizam o middleware do Nextjs para fazer autenticação e autorização.

    "clean_text": "Lessons from Next.js Middleware vulnerability CVE-2025-29927: Why Route-Level Auth Checks Are Worth the Extra Work Hey r/nextjs community, With the recent disclosure of CVE-2025-29927 (the Next.js middleware bypass vulnerability), I wanted to share some thoughts on an authentication patterns that I always use in all my projects and that can help keep your apps secure, even in the face of framework-level vulnerabilities like this. For those who haven't heard, Vercel recently disclosed a critical vulnerability in Next.js middleware. By adding a special header (x-middleware-subrequest) to requests, attackers can completely bypass middleware-based authentication checks. This affects apps that rely on middleware for auth or security checks without additional validation at the route level. We can all agree that middleware-based auth is convenient (implement once, protect many routes), this vulnerability highlights why checking auth at the route level provides an additional layer of security. Yes, it's more verbose and requires more code, but it creates a defense-in-depth approach that's resilient to middleware bypasses. Here's a pattern I've been using, some people always ask why I don't just use the middleware, but that incident proves its effectiveness. First, create a requireAuth function: export async function requireAuth(Roles: Role[] = []) { const session = await auth(); if (!session) { return redirect('/signin'); } if (Roles.length && !userHasRoles(session.user, Roles)) { return { authorized: false, session }; } return { authorized: true, session }; } // Helper function to check roles function userHasRoles(user: Session[\"user\"], roles: Role[]) { const userRoles = user?.roles || []; const userRolesName = userRoles.map((role) => role.role.name); return roles.every((role) => userRolesName.includes(role)); } Then, implement it in every route that needs protection: export default async function AdminPage() { const { authorized } = await requireAuth([Role.ADMIN]); if (!authorized) return <Unauthorized />; // Your protected page content return ( <div> <h1>Admin Dashboard</h1> {/ Rest of your protected content /} </div> ); } Benefits of This Approach 1. Resilience to middleware vulnerabilities: Even if middleware is bypassed, each route still performs its own auth check 2. Fine-grained control: Different routes can require different roles or permissions 3. Explicit security: Makes the security requirements of each route clear in the code 4. Early returns: Auth failures are handled before any sensitive logic executes I use Next.js Full-Stack-Kit for several projects and it implements this pattern consistently across all protected routes. What I like about that pattern is that auth checks aren't hidden away in some middleware config - they're right there at the top of each page component, making the security requirements explicit and reviewable. At first, It might seem tedious to add auth checks to every route (especially when you have dozens of them), this vulnerability shows why that extra work is worth it. Defense in depth is a fundamental security principle, and implementing auth checks at multiple levels can save you from framework-level vulnerabilities. Stay safe guys!",
    "clean_comments": [
      "Level 0: Authorisation checks should be done as high and early as reasonable. If it's simple condition like signin status or role and same rule would be applied to whole segment anyway, there's no need to spread it to each child route. Also you'd avoid more expensive RSC execution in case a redirect is necessary. If the check is more granular e.g. \".where id=? and foo.owner=?\", 123, user.id)\" then it needs to be done at data access layer obviously. Doing authentication in middleware or equivalent concept is another thing. Since it will be done anyway, might as well handle it right away. This would also make standardized auth solutions easier when the whole authentication process could be a preliminary step, establishing the internal user data as result.",
      "Level 1: Would you then say that authorization should be done at the highest level route that needs to be protected through something like a template.tsx?",
      "Level 1: What are your thoughts on the potential performance implications of auth checks in middleware? I’m not the sort of dev who typically obsesses much about perf, but this scenario is one exception. My understanding (correct me if I’m wrong) is that for a typical app with a partially personalised UI - e.g. a dashboard with the user’s avatar in the top-right - most of the outer app “shell” is static (i.e. the same thing is shown to all users). In this case, it feels wrong to me to dump a blocking auth service check in middleware. Instead, you could conceivably render parts of the screen immediately and then any slower, user-specific elements stream in and replace their skeleton loaders. Additionally, you only need to do a single db/auth service hit to verify a user, as this result can then just use React’s cache function to reuse the result across the same server render pass. One final pattern I’ve been using is “optimistic” session checks in middleware, which is basically instant as it only checks for a JWT. Of course it’s technically not secure because it could be tampered with, but for rendering basic user data there’s no issue. And for operations that really need full server security, you use row-level security, auth guards in RSCs, server actions, etc. In this way, you get immediate UI rendering with secure data access (it’s just a bit more cumbersome than having a single middleware check). I think seb markbage supports this pattern from one of his tweets. Also could be a motivating factor for features like partial pre-rendering",
      "Level 2: Parsing and validating JWT token ( let's say HS256) takes ~5-20 microseconds. Asymmetric ones will be slower but even if it would take 1ms you are completely fine for blocking for 1ms in any typical web application. Sessions make much less sense for distributed system but if you're close to db it's perfectly viable. Usually it's just a single index lookup which should be very fast. Again shouldn't be an issue. Most framework default to doing this every request and it isn't an issue. Why this is an issue with NextJS? Because middleware runs possibly 10000km away from the data. Also people do crazy things like calling an external server ( Supabase for example) to do the auth check which obviously is extremely slow. My advice? Use JWT and just validate it locally. Extremely fast and simple."

      "Level 0: What’s everyone’s thoughts on passkeys these days? The root cause of this CVE is that the authenticator (your BLE security key) has no built-in mechanism to independently verify the authenticity of the host (domain) it’s communicating with. This absence of “host verification” allows attackers to MITM the BLE-based authentication, redirecting legitimate responses to malicious endpoints. Cool. So your fancy BLE security key basically trusts whoever it connects with over Bluetooth, without ever double-checking who’s on the other end. Oops. Not an easy fix, but clearly authenticators need a way to explicitly verify the domain before signing responses. Without domain validation PassKeys are vulnerable to subtle but powerful MITM attacks like this one. As far as mitigations I can think of a few: BLE Domain Binding: Enhance the security of BLE keys by incorporating explicit domain checks directly into the BLE handshake. This would ensure that the authenticator independently verifies the host’s identity, preventing unauthorized access from third-party devices. Out-of-Band Domain Checks: Implement a secondary, trusted channel (such as NFC or a “tap-to-confirm” feature on the security device) to validate the domain requesting PassKey credentials. This would provide an additional layer of verification before the device trusts the request without hesitation. Challenge-Based Verification: Have the authenticator issue a cryptographic challenge specifically tied to the domain. The authenticator won’t finalize the authentication unless the host proves its legitimacy cryptographically. In other words, make the domain prove it’s not an imposter first.",

These are serious — with a CVSS v3.1 base score of 9.8, and they allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the cluster’s Ingress NGINX Controller pod and potentially access all secrets across all namespaces. If you’re running Kubernetes in production, please read on. TL;DR Vulnerabilities:* CVE-2025-1097, CVE-2025-1098, CVE-2025-24514, CVE-2025-1974 Severity:* Critical (9.8 CVSS v3.1) Potential Impact:* Full cluster takeover (access to all secrets in the cluster). Affected Component:* Admission controller inside Ingress NGINX (a very commonly used ingress controller). Summary Ingress NGINX Controller is massively popular. Wiz says they’ve found over 6,500 publicly exposed clusters – including some at Fortune 500 companies – that have the admission controller wide open to the internet, making them critical targets. Ingress NGINX by default deploys a validating webhook (admission controller) that checks incoming ingress objects for compliance. But in these vulnerable versions, that webhook can be abused to inject malicious NGINX configs. That eventually leads to RCE within the Ingress NGINX pod. Combine that with the admission controller’s elevated privileges, and it’s game over. Affected Versions / Fix Fixed in:* Ingress NGINX Controller versions 1.12.1 and 1.11.5. * If you’re running an older release, you’re at risk. Patch ASAP. Mitigation Steps 1. Update to the latest Ingress NGINX Controller (1.12.1+ or 1.11.5+). 2. Lock down the admission webhook so it’s only reachable by the Kubernetes API Server. * This means restricting network policies or ensuring the webhook isn’t publicly exposed. 3. If you can’t patch, you can: Temporarily disable* the validating webhook by removing the ingress-nginx-admission ValidatingWebhookConfiguration and the --validating-webhook argument. (But remember: re-enable it once you upgrade, because it does serve useful security checks!) Apply strict network policies* so only the K8s control plane can talk to this webhook.",

    "clean_text": "Critical Vulnerability: CrushFTP CVE-2025-31161 Auth Bypass and Post-Exploitation TL;DR: CVE-2025-31161 is a critical severity vulnerability allowing attackers to control how user authentication is handled by CrushFTP managed file transfer (MFT) software. We strongly recommend patching immediately to avoid affected versions 10.0.0 through 10.8.3 and 11.0.0 through 11.3.0. Successful exploitation of CVE-2025-31161 would give attackers admin level access across the CrushFTP application for further compromise. On 3 April 2025, Huntress observed in-the-wild exploitation of CVE-2025-31161, an authentication bypass vulnerability in versions of the CrushFTP software. We uncovered further post-exploitation activity leveraging the MeshCentral agent and other malware that we will discuss in this writeup. While doing some further analysis, we uncovered potential evidence of compromise as early as 30 March 2025, which seemed to be testing access, and did not spawn any external processes to CrushFTP. In a recent post from the ShadowServer team, they state as of March 30 there were \\~1,500 vulnerable instances of CrushFTP publicly exposed to the internet. We have published a proof of concept, IOCs, and analysis on Mesh and AnyDesk post exploitations in this blog. What is CVE-2025-31161? CVE-2025-31161 is a 9.8 CVSS critical severity vulnerability that affects how the CrushFTP file transfer application handles user authentication. At the time of writing, the NIST NVD entry states the description: >CrushFTP versions 10.0.0 through 10.8.3 and 11.0.0 through 11.3.0 are affected by a vulnerability in the S3 authorization header processing that allows authentication bypass. Remote and unauthenticated HTTP requests to CrushFTP with known usernames can be used to impersonate a user and conduct actions on their behalf, including administrative actions and data retrieval. This vulnerability is patched and is mitigated in CrushFTP versions 11.3.1+ and 10.8.4+. Huntress has validated and confirmed the authentication bypass is prevented in patched versions. Please ensure your own installations of CrushFTP are updated to the latest versions. If your CrushFTP instance is publicly exposed to the open Internet, we strongly recommend you patch immediately. Upon successful exploitation, an adversary may gain access to the administrator user account for the CrushFTP application, and leverage this to create new backdoor accounts, access files (upload and download), obtain code execution, and achieve full control of the vulnerable server. The vulnerability was assigned a CVE on March 26, and the Shadowserver Foundation first reported CVE-2025-31161 exploitation activity on March 31. The exploitation of CVE-2025-31161 is indicative of a concerning trend that we’ve seen across several incidents, where threat actors are targeting MFT platforms as a way to deliver disruptive attacks. These platforms are typically external-facing and house sensitive enterprise data, making them a favorite for threat actors. As such, prompt patching is critical. Within our partner base we have seen 148 unique endpoints with the CrushFTP software installed as a service, with 95 of these running major versions 10 and 11. Approximately 72 different companies within our customer base were currently running unpatched versions of CrushFTP. Customers have been notified of the urgency to upgrade. Numerous other security firms have discussed CVE-2025-31161 (hat tip to Rapid7 AttackerKB and Outpost24 amongst others) and thanks to their shared insights, Huntress was able to recreate a proof-of-concept (PoC) with ease. The core of this vulnerability is the S3 authentication functionality included as a part of CrushFTP. Due to logic bugs in the underlying source code (which Project Discovery did a fantastic job outlining), a mere Authorization header in an HTTP request is all that is needed to bypass authentication without valid username or password credentials. What is Huntress Doing? Post-exploitation efforts are already thoroughly covered by Huntress detection rules. In response to these intrusions specifically, we crafted detectors to find child processes invoked underneath the CrushFTP service executable. For community members not yet protected with Huntress, there are two Sigma rules available in the public SigmaHQ repository for: 1. Detecting “Remote Access Tool - MeshAgent Command Execution via MeshCentral” 2. Detecting “Remote Access Tool - AnyDesk Silent Installation” If you think you could be impacted, abuse our trial to quickly discover anything shady left behind.",

In the version prior to the patched one, a condition was added to track the number of discovered middleware instances and set a maximum depth of 5. This depth was stored in a specific header. However, a developer—who was apparently “vibe coding”—added a condition to completely skip the middleware if its depth exceeded 5. The security researcher later discovered this vulnerability when they noticed an unusual header being sent with each request. Since Next.js is open-source, they reviewed the code, identified the issue, and the rest is history. You can check the vulnerable code here: <URL>"

WinPE: Mount and Customize | Microsoft Learn and step 6 here; WinPE: Create bootable media | Microsoft Learn if it was at least in the image, thats half of it effectively done (not including the reimaging your devices part) and you just have to enable the revocation part via registry which you could do with group policy. The idea was in my situation, to include this update whilst we're reimaging devices which over time would cover a fair chunk and then manually do the rest. But no dice. Edit: used the wrong update when updating WinPE, in the latest version, also had the wrong ADK/winPE",

Recently updated my Gigabyte X870E Aorus Master from F5a to F5 for the \"AMD CPU microcode signature verification vulnerability (CVE-2024-36347)\" patch. Had updated AMD Chipset Driver to 7.01.08.129 before and after the F5 BIOS update. Got random 4d error on boot up, stuck on the screen with Aorus logo without the spinning wheel. Tried reset BIOS to default settings, no help. Tried turning off PSU then hold power button for 30 secs, no good. Redownload and reflash F5 bios again then turn off memory restore context. Things seems to work well. On boot up the next day, remember I haven't turn on secure boot after reflashing BIOS. Turn it back on and the random 4d boot up error start happening again. Afterwards, I noticed some of the BIOS settings was changed after secure boot changes, including memory context restore changing back to auto. Turned it off, thought everything was stable. Turned on my PC the next day and it got stuck with 4d error again. Seems like there's something wrong with secure boot or the way I turned it on. User standard/custom mode both causes 4d error randomly. But when it boot successfully, everything works fine. Did a quick 30 min CPU+RAM and RAM test via OCCT and nothing was found. Any help please?",

    "clean_text": "Nvidia Patch Incompleteness Poses Risks in AI Container Security Trend Micro has discovered a critical security flaw in Nvidia's patch for the Container Toolkit that still leaves AI environments vulnerable to attacks. Key Points: - Trend Micro flags Nvidia's incomplete patch for a critical vulnerability. - The flaw allows potential container escape attacks and unauthorized access. - Organizations using Nvidia's toolkit are directly at risk, especially with default settings. - The patch doesn't properly enforce checks against race conditions, allowing exploitation. - A denial-of-service flaw has also been identified affecting Docker on Linux systems. Trend Micro researchers have flagged significant issues with Nvidia's patching of a critical vulnerability found in the Nvidia Container Toolkit, originally addressed last September. The vulnerability, identified as CVE-2024-0132, scored an alarming 9 out of 10 on the CVSS scale, categorizing it as high priority. However, Trend Micro's findings indicate that the patch is not fully effective, leaving enterprises exposed to dangerous container escape attacks. Such vulnerabilities enable hackers to execute arbitrary commands and access sensitive data, putting organizations' proprietary information at significant risk. The security gap lies in the incomplete enforcement of checks that would typically prevent exploitation via the time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition. This flaw allows a crafted container to maneuver past isolation barriers and manipulate host resources. The potential fallout from such exploitation includes theft of sensitive information, prolonged system downtime, and substantial operational disruptions. Organizations relying on the Nvidia Container Toolkit for their AI workloads and Docker environments must be aware of these risks, particularly those operating with default configurations or the newer features of the toolkit. Additionally, alongside this vulnerability, Trend Micro has pointed out a related denial-of-service issue specifically affecting Docker configurations on Linux systems. Containers using specific mount options can lead to unchecked growth in the Linux mount table, creating a service disruption that can hinder remote access and overall operation. To mitigate these threats, Trend Micro advocates for stricter access controls and the disabling of unnecessary features within the Nvidia toolkit.

So lautet eine der Grundregeln des Internets, die natürlich auch Autos betrifft. Denn mittlerweile ist eine beachtliche Anzahl an Fahrzeugen dauerhaft vernetzt. Wie gravierend ein solcher Cyberangriff sich auf die Sicherheit von Leib und Leben auswirken kann, zeigen Forscher von PCAutomotive: Den Sicherheitsspezialisten ist es gelungen, einen Nissan verdeckt aus der Ferne zu kapern und zu steuern. Golden Dayz \\/ shutterstock.com Vernetzung macht Autos verwundbarer Geht es nach einer Einschätzung von statista, wird im Jahr 2030 rund die Hälfte des europäischen Pkw-Bestands – etwa 255 Millionen Fahrzeuge – mit dem Internet verbunden sein. Blickt man weiter ins Jahr 2035, dürfte dieser Anteil in den USA bereits bei nahezu 100 Prozent der 290 Millionen Fahrzeuge liegen. Auch China zieht nach: Dort sollen bis dahin rund 72 Prozent der 350 Millionen Autos als Connected Cars unterwegs sein. Damit ist die Mehrheit der Fahrzeuge in diesen Ländern bereits vernetzt, Tendenz steigend. Dies bringt jedoch nicht nur Fortschritt und Komfort, sondern öffnet auch neue Angriffsmöglichkeiten für Kriminelle. Mit der zunehmenden Vernetzung der Fahrzeuge steigt das Risiko von Cyberangriffen, die von Datendiebstahl bis hin zur Manipulation von Fahrfunktionen reichen können. Über Bluetooth eingehackt Inwieweit sich tatsächlich sensible Fahrfunktionen kapern lassen, haben IT-Sicherheitsexperten von PCAutomotive auf der Hackerkonferenz Black Hat Asia 2025 demonstriert. Für ihre Präsentation verwendeten sie einen Nissan Leaf der zweiten Generation, Baujahr 2020. Dabei erfolgte der Angriff durch ein Einfallstor in der Bluetooth-Schnittstelle des Elektroautos. Schwachstellen im Infotainmentsystem ermöglichten darüber hinaus eine Rechteerweiterung und schließlich einen verdeckten Fernzugriff über die Mobilfunkverbindung. Dramatische Folgen für die Sicherheit der Insassen Die Folgen einer solchen Schwachstelle könnten kaum gravierender sein. Angreifer können den Standort des Fahrzeugs verfolgen und Inhalte des Infotainment-Bildschirms manipulieren oder mit Screenshots speichern. Gespräche können heimlich aufgezeichnet und sogar über den Lautsprecher des Autos wiedergegeben werden. Es kommt aber noch schlimmer: Auch physische Funktionen des Kraftfahrzeuges wie Türen, Scheibenwischer, Spiegel, Fenster und auch Leuchten können nach der Hacker-Übernahme sowohl aus dem Stand als auch während der Fahrt ferngesteuert werden. Sogar die Lenkung des Fahrzeugs soll laut netzwelt.de aus der Ferne manipulierbar sein – der Albtraum eines jeden Autofahrers. Was einst nach düsterer Science-Fiction klang, ist heute eine reale und ernstzunehmende Bedrohung. Cyberangriffe werden immer noch unterschätzt Laut der Präsentation von PCAutomotive sind die Cyberexperten auf insgesamt zehn Sicherheitslücken gestoßen. Diese sind mittlerweile unter den Codes PCA\\NISSAN\\009, PCA\\NISSAN\\012 und CVE-2025-32056 bis CVE-2025-32063 bekannt. Die Meldung an Nissan erfolgte bereits im August 2023. Dennoch hätten die Gegenmaßnahmen seitens des japanischen Autoherstellers viel Zeit in Anspruch genommen. Details will man bei Nissan aus Sicherheitsgründen nicht preisgeben. Vielleicht aber auch aus Kalkül – denn die Hersteller tun noch immer zu wenig gegen Cyberangriffe. Immer wieder werden neue Schwachstellen bei verschiedenen Marken und Modellen bekannt. Allerdings sind nicht nur die Autobauer Schuld: Cybersicherheit kostet bares Geld und setzt man die Kundenbrille auf, handelt es sich um eine Verbesserung, die man schlicht nicht sehen kann.

    "clean_text": "Critical Apache Roller Insufficient Session Expiration on Password Change Vulnerability CVE-2025-24859 A session management vulnerability exists in Apache Roller before version 6.1.5 where active user sessions are not properly invalidated after password changes. When a user's password is changed, either by the user themselves or by an administrator, existing sessions remain active and usable. This allows continued access to the application through old sessions even after password changes, potentially enabling unauthorized access if credentials were compromised. This issue affects Apache Roller versions up to and including 6.1.4. The vulnerability is fixed in Apache Roller 6.1.5 by implementing centralized session management that properly invalidates all active sessions when passwords are changed or users are disabled.

    "clean_text": "Microsoft Addresses Windows 11 Users' Concerns About New inetpub Folder Microsoft has reassured Windows users that the newly appeared inetpub folder is an intentional security measure following recent updates. Key Points: - The inetpub folder is created as part of a security update to mitigate a significant vulnerability. - Users should not delete the inetpub folder despite its empty appearance. - The folder enhances protection against privilege escalation exploits on Windows systems. Windows 10 and 11 users have recently noticed a seemingly empty directory called 'inetpub' appearing on their systems after installing Microsoft's April 2025 Patch Tuesday updates. While many users may see this folder as unnecessary and consider deleting it, Microsoft has explicitly warned against such action, clarifying that it plays a critical role in protecting systems from exploitation of a newly patched vulnerability, CVE-2025-21204. This vulnerability poses a serious risk as it allows unauthorized users to potentially gain system-level access, posing a significant threat to the integrity of a user's system. The inetpub folder is typically associated with Microsoft's Internet Information Services (IIS) web server software. However, even users without IIS installed are affected by this change. The folder is created with specific read-only SYSTEM-level permissions, which enhances security measures against potential privilege escalation attempts. Microsoft reassures users that there is currently no evidence of active exploitation regarding CVE-2025-21204, but maintaining the folder's integrity is key to preventing future security risks. Thus, rather than being a cause for alarm, the folder signifies a proactive step by Microsoft in safeguarding Windows systems.

The leaked data includes highly sensitive assets such as JKS files, encrypted SSO passwords, key files, and enterprise manager JPS keys, affecting over 140,000 tenants. The attacker, who has been active since January 2025, is demanding payment for data removal and even incentivizing assistance in decrypting the stolen credentials. Initial analysis suggests the breach may have originated from a vulnerable Oracle login subdomain (login.\\[region\\].oraclecloud.com), possibly linked to CVE-2021-35587—a critical flaw in Oracle Fusion Middleware’s Access Manager. The affected endpoint, last updated in 2014, underscores a lack of patch management and highlights broader concerns around supply chain vulnerabilities.

    "clean_text": "Cybercriminals Exploit Critical NTLM Spoofing Vulnerability in Windows Systems Hackers are actively taking advantage of a serious vulnerability in Windows systems, CVE-2025-24054, to leak sensitive authentication data. Key Points: - Vulnerability facilitates NTLM hash leakage through spoofing techniques. - Attackers can escalate privileges and move laterally within networks. - Exploitation requires minimal user interaction, increasing risk. - Recent campaigns target government and private institutions in Eastern Europe. Cybercriminals are currently exploiting a severe vulnerability identified as CVE-2025-24054, which relates to the NTLM authentication protocol used within Windows systems. This vulnerability allows attackers to manipulate file path handling in a way that triggers SMB authentication requests, revealing user NTLM hashes through unsuspecting file operations. What makes this exploit particularly concerning is its ability to occur with minimal user interaction, such as simply unzipping a ZIP file that contains a malicious .library-ms file. As soon as the file is extracted, the user's authentication data can be leaked, paving the way for further exploitation by the attackers. Recent reports indicate that threat actors began utilizing this vulnerability shortly after Microsoft's attempted patch on March 11, 2025. Campaigns observed in late March specifically targeted institutions in Poland and Romania, showcasing the vulnerability's appeal to malicious groups. By embedding harmful files in spear-phishing emails, attackers prompted unwitting users to execute the harmful ZIP archives, triggering the vulnerability and exposing their NTLM hashes. The attackers were then able to leverage these hashes for lateral movements within networks, thereby gaining unauthorized access and potentially escalating privileges, all while evading detection.

    "clean_text": "Hardware Can’t Be Trusted — So We Built Around It A recent vulnerability (CVE-2025-27840) affecting the popular ESP32 microcontroller is exposing Bitcoin hardware wallets to key theft. The flaw includes: • Exploitable firmware/module updates • Weak RNG entropy → brute-forceable keypairs • Remote signature injection & transaction hijacking This isn’t just about one chip — it’s about a fundamental design flaw: If trust is rooted in hardware, the system is only as strong as its weakest microcontroller. What We Did Instead We’ve been working on an architecture that treats trust as behavior, not assumption. No reliance on global consensus or secure hardware. Instead: • Agents validate state locally • Trust scores are based on entropy quality, signature patterns, and behavior • Adaptive PoW rejects anomalies — even if signed • Entropy audits detect weak randomness in real time • Devices that act “out of spec” are automatically isolated or demoted If a key becomes guessable or spoofed, the system doesn’t alert — it acts. Big Picture: Cryptography isn’t just math. It’s entropy. It’s behavior. It’s architecture. The next evolution in blockchain security won't come from stronger chips. It’ll come from smarter systems that expect them to fail. Let me know if anyone’s working on similar agent-based or entropy-scoring models. Always curious to compare architectures.",

    "clean_text": "CVE program's funding crisis: Implications and strategic response Today, the cybersecurity community faced a critical juncture as the U.S. government's contract with MITRE Corporation to develop, operate and modernize the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) program, as well as related efforts like CWE, was set to expire. Adam Khan, April 16, 2025 Today, the cybersecurity community faced a critical juncture as the U.S. government's contract with MITRE Corporation to develop, operate and modernize the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) program, as well as related efforts like CWE, was set to expire. MITRE warned of \"multiple impacts to CVE, including deterioration of national vulnerability databases and advisories, tool vendors, incident response operations, and all manner of critical infrastructure.\" This development threatened the continuity of a foundational element in global cybersecurity infrastructure. In a last-minute intervention, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) extended funding and awarded an 11-month bridge contract to ensure there would be no lapse in CVE services. <URL> Understanding the CVE Program The CVE program, established in 1999 and managed by MITRE, provides a standardized system for identifying and cataloging publicly known cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Each vulnerability is assigned a unique identifier (e.g., CVE-2025-12345), facilitating consistent communication among security professionals, vendors and organizations worldwide. CVE records are categorized based on the type of vulnerability, affected software or hardware, and potential impact. These records typically include a brief description, references to public advisories or patches, and severity ratings, when available. The lifecycle of a CVE follows a structured process: 1. Discovery – A researcher, vendor or organization identifies a potential security flaw. 2. Submission – The issue is reported to a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA), which validates and assigns a CVE ID. 3. Disclosure – After validation, the vulnerability is publicly disclosed either by the discoverer or the CNA, depending on coordination. 4. Publication – The CVE entry is published to the CVE List and made available to the community for integration into tools and databases. 5. Ongoing Maintenance – MITRE and CNAs monitor for corrections, updates and additional reference material to keep the records accurate and useful. The CVE program serves as a backbone for security tools and frameworks such as the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), which augments CVE records with CVSS scores and metadata, and the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE), which categorizes the underlying flaw types. By offering a centralized, transparent, and community-driven system, the CVE program supports timely vulnerability management and helps coordinate global response efforts. Importance of the CVE program The CVE program is foundational to global cybersecurity efforts for several reasons: Standardization:* It offers a common language for describing vulnerabilities, enabling effective collaboration across different organizations and sectors.​ Integration:* Many security tools and processes rely on CVE identifiers to function correctly, including vulnerability scanners, patch management systems and threat intelligence platforms. Coordination:* The program supports coordinated vulnerability disclosure, allowing vendors and researchers to manage and communicate about security issues efficiently.​ Without the CVE system, the cybersecurity community would face challenges in tracking, prioritizing and mitigating vulnerabilities, leading to increased risks and potential exploitation by threat actors. Implications for the cybersecurity industry The potential lapse in CVE program funding raised several concerns:​ Operational disruption:* A halt in CVE assignments could disrupt security vendors, security teams such as Incident responders and many others, as organizations would lack standardized identifiers for new vulnerabilities.​ Increased risk:* Delayed vulnerability identification and remediation efforts could expose systems to prolonged periods of risk.​ Fragmentation:* In the absence of a centralized system, disparate methods for tracking vulnerabilities might emerge, leading to inconsistencies and confusion.​ These challenges underscore the critical role of the CVE program in maintaining cybersecurity resilience across industries and national infrastructures. Strategic response and recommendations To ensure the sustainability and effectiveness of the CVE program, the following measures are recommended: 1. Diversify funding sources Engage stakeholders from the private sector, international partners and non-profit organizations to contribute to the program's funding, reducing reliance on a single government entity.​ 2. Establish independent governance The formation of the CVE Foundation aims to provide a neutral, community-driven governance structure, enhancing the program's resilience and global trust.​ 3. Enhance transparency Regular communication about the program's status, funding and strategic direction can build confidence among users and contributors.​ 4. Invest in automation Leveraging automation and artificial intelligence can improve the efficiency of vulnerability identification and management processes.​ 5. Strengthen international collaboration Foster partnerships with international cybersecurity organizations to ensure a unified approach to vulnerability management and to share best practices. European Union's proactive measures In response to the evolving cybersecurity landscape, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) has launched the European Vulnerability Database (EUVD). This initiative embraces a multi-stakeholder approach by collecting publicly available vulnerability information from multiple sources, including Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs), vendors and existing databases. The EUVD aims to enhance transparency and efficiency in vulnerability management across the EU. Ensuring resilience and sustainability moving forward The recent funding crisis of the CVE program highlights the fragility of essential cybersecurity infrastructures. While immediate disruptions have been averted, it is imperative for the global cybersecurity community to take proactive steps to ensure the resilience and sustainability of vulnerability management systems. Collaborative efforts, diversified funding and international cooperation will be key to safeguarding our digital ecosystems.

    "clean_text": "CISA Warns of Credential Risks Linked to Oracle Cloud Compromise Unauthorized access to Oracle Cloud's legacy environment poses substantial risks to organizations and individuals, according to CISA's high-priority advisory. Key Points: - Approximately 6 million records may have been exfiltrated, including sensitive credentials. - Exploitation of a critical vulnerability in Oracle Access Manager allowed unauthorized access. - Password resets and enhanced security measures are crucial for affected users. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has issued an urgent alert following alarming reports of a possible compromise within Oracle Cloud's infrastructure. An individual known as 'rose87168' claimed to have extracted around 6 million sensitive records from Oracle’s Single Sign-On and Lightweight Directory Access Protocol systems. These records could potentially include critical information such as usernames, passwords, and authentication tokens, which are essential for maintaining secure access to various services. CISA emphasizes the serious ramifications of credential leaks, as they may allow threat actors to escalate privileges, maneuver through corporate networks, and launch targeted phishing attacks. CISA’s advisory also pinpoints that the attacker exploited CVE-2021-35587, a severe vulnerability that has remained unpatched in Oracle Fusion Middleware since 2014. While Oracle refutes claims of a significant breach, the investigation by CrowdStrike and the FBI reveals the potential for long-term unauthorized access if sensitive credential material has indeed been exposed. CISA urges organizations and individual users to take immediate action, such as resetting passwords and implementing multi-factor authentication, to mitigate the fallout from this incident. The agency's guidance highlights that lax management of credentials, especially hardcoded in scripts and applications, can lead to dire security breaches if compromised.

    "clean_text": "Erlang/OTP SSH Vulnerability May Risk Thousands of Devices A critical flaw in Erlang/OTP's SSH library exposes numerous devices to potential remote hacking attacks. Key Points: - CVE-2025-32433 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via unauthenticated SSH connections. - The vulnerability affects any SSH server using Erlang/OTP's SSH library, including many Cisco and Ericsson devices. - The flaw may lead to unauthorized data access, complete device takeover, or even ransomware installation. A security vulnerability has been discovered in the Erlang/OTP SSH library, assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2025-32433, with a maximum CVSS score of 10, indicating its critical severity. This flaw allows an attacker to send connection protocol messages prior to the completion of SSH authentication, effectively enabling them to execute arbitrary code within the SSH daemon. If the SSH daemon runs with root access, which is common, this poses a severe risk as it gives attackers complete control over affected devices. The direct implications could be detrimental, affecting high-availability systems used across sectors including finance and telecommunications. Researchers warn that systems relying on Erlang/OTP, particularly those connected to remote access services, are highly susceptible. The wide adoption of Erlang in the infrastructure of major companies like Cisco and Ericsson increases the potential impact. Compromised devices could result in unauthorized access to highly sensitive information or serve as a platform for launching further attacks, such as ransomware. Users have been advised to implement firewall rules as a stopgap measure until a comprehensive patch is applied, specifically in versions OTP-27.3.3, OTP-26.2.5.11, and OTP-25.3.2.20 that were recently released to mitigate the risk. What measures can organizations take to better protect themselves from such vulnerabilities? Learn More: Security Week Want to stay updated on the latest cyber threats? Subscribe to /r/PwnHub",

    "clean_text": "Atlassian and Cisco Issue Critical Patches for High-Severity Vulnerabilities Atlassian and Cisco have addressed multiple severe vulnerabilities that could lead to remote code execution and other significant security risks. Key Points: - Atlassian released seven updates patching four vulnerabilities across its popular products. - Cisco patched multiple security flaws in Webex App, Secure Network Analytics, and Nexus Dashboard. - Both companies reported no known exploits of these vulnerabilities in the wild. Atlassian has released critical patches for four high-severity vulnerabilities affecting its products, including Bamboo, Confluence, and Jira. These flaws, some publicly disclosed nearly six years ago, included remote code execution risks and denial-of-service vulnerabilities. The updates specifically address defects tracked as CVE-2024-57699 and CVE-2021-33813, which could be exploited to compromise systems without any authentication required. This highlights a pressing need for organizations using these software solutions to apply updates promptly to protect their environments from potential attacks. Similarly, Cisco has rolled out patches for several security vulnerabilities in their software offerings. Among these is a high-severity flaw in the Webex App (CVE-2025-20236), which can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code through deceptive meeting invites. Additionally, Cisco's patches fixed medium-severity issues that could grant authenticated attackers unintended shell access or reveal valid LDAP usernames to unauthenticated users. Both companies have indicated they are not aware of these vulnerabilities being actively exploited, yet the patches should be applied to mitigate future risks.

    "clean_text": "Critical Flaw CVE-2025-24054 Active—NTLM Credentials at Risk A medium-severity flaw in Windows is under active attack, allowing attackers to steal NTLM credentials through minimal user interaction. Key Points: - CVE-2025-24054 exploits NTLM authentication protocol, allowing credential theft. - Active exploitation reported since March 19, targeting institutions in Poland and Romania. - Attackers use phishing campaigns to deliver malicious .library-ms files for NTLM hash extraction. The recently identified CVE-2025-24054 vulnerability in Microsoft Windows poses a significant risk by allowing unauthorized attackers to spoof NTLM credentials across networks. NTLM is an outdated authentication protocol that has been largely deprecated in favor of newer technologies like Kerberos. However, its continued presence in Windows environments presents an enduring target for cybercriminals. This flaw can be triggered with minimal user interaction, such as a simple click or file inspection, illustrating how effortless it is for attackers to exploit it. Once activated, it can lead to the extraction of NTLM hashes, which can be further leveraged in malicious campaigns to compromise systems. Following the initial reports of exploitation, cybersecurity firms identified numerous campaigns, particularly targeting government and private institutions in regions like Poland and Romania. Attackers have been observed distributing malicious links via emails, using trusted cloud storage platforms to evade detection. As these malicious .library-ms files take advantage of a ZIP archive format, they facilitate an SMB authentication request, enabling hash leaks with no direct execution of the files required. This seamless method of infiltration showcases the urgency for organizations to patch these vulnerabilities promptly and address the risks associated with NTLM to safeguard their networks against credential theft and further attacks.

    "clean_text": "Critical Security Flaw in ASUS AiCloud Routers Exposes Users to Remote Attacks ASUS has revealed a serious vulnerability in its AiCloud-enabled routers that could allow remote attackers to access and execute unauthorized functions. Key Points: - Vulnerability CVE-2025-2492 has a critical score of 9.2, indicating severe risk. - Affected routers require immediate firmware updates to safeguard against exploitation. - Users are advised to create strong, unique passwords for their networks and devices. ASUS recently confirmed a critical security vulnerability affecting its AiCloud-enabled routers, identified as CVE-2025-2492. This flaw has a CVSS score of 9.2 out of 10, marking it as extremely high-risk. The vulnerability stems from improper authentication controls in specific ASUS router firmware, which can be exploited by crafted requests, potentially allowing remote attackers to execute unauthorized actions on affected devices. In response to this threat, ASUS has issued firmware updates to rectify the issue. Users with affected firmware versions, including 3.0.0.43823, 0.0.43863, 0.0.4388, and 3.0.0.6102, must promptly update to the latest version. Until then, users should ensure their login and Wi-Fi passwords are robust. ASUS emphasizes stronger passwords, recommending combinations of capital letters, numbers, and symbols, avoid using the same passwords across devices, and refrain from predictable patterns such as consecutive numbers or letters. Alternatively, if users are unable to apply patches immediately, disabling AiCloud and any external access services is highly recommended to reduce potential exposure.

    "clean_text": "Critical PyTorch Vulnerability Lets Attackers Run Malicious Code A serious vulnerability in PyTorch allows attackers to execute remote code, even when using previously recommended security measures. Key Points: - CVE-2025-32434 affects all PyTorch versions up to 2.5.1. - Vulnerability exists in the torch.load function with weights_only=True parameter. - Remote code execution can happen without user interaction, posing significant risks. The recently identified CVE-2025-32434 vulnerability in PyTorch is alarming for developers and organizations relying on machine learning frameworks. Discovered by researcher Ji'an Zhou, this security flaw enables remote code execution (RCE) when using the torch.load function with the weights_only=True parameter—a combination formerly recommended as a safe option for loading models. This contradiction in guidance puts many users at risk, as the vulnerability allows attackers to craft malicious model files that can execute arbitrary code on victim systems, potentially leading to catastrophic security breaches. The impact of this vulnerability is particularly stark for machine learning pipelines that automatically download models from external sources or collaborative environments. With a CVSS score of 9.3, this critical vulnerability highlights how even established security measures can have unanticipated flaws. Users are urged to update to PyTorch version 2.6.0 or later to mitigate the risks or, as an interim measure, avoid using torch.load with weights_only=True. The incident underscores the importance of maintaining up-to-date dependencies in any production environment dealing with sensitive data, reminding organizations that vulnerabilities can lurk even in features designed to enhance security. How can organizations better safeguard their machine learning pipelines against such vulnerabilities? Learn More: Cyber Security News Want to stay updated on the latest cyber threats?

Key Points: - CVE-2025-25364 allows local privilege escalation on Speedify VPN for macOS. - The vulnerability is caused by improper input handling in the helper tool. - Exploiting the flaw can lead to arbitrary command execution as root. - Speedify VPN has released an update addressing this critical security issue. - Users must upgrade to version 15.4.1 or higher to ensure their systems are protected. The discovered vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-25364, is a significant security risk for users of Speedify VPN's macOS application. It resides in the me.connectify.SMJobBlessHelper helper tool, which executes system-level operations with root privileges. The security flaw arises from improper input validation in the XPC interface of this tool, allowing local attackers to inject malicious commands that the system would execute with root privileges. Specifically, the commands can be injected through two user-controlled fields in incoming XPC messages, cmdPath and cmdBin, which are not adequately sanitized. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to local privilege escalation, allowing attackers not only to execute arbitrary commands but also to read, modify, or delete critical system files, and potentially install persistent malware. Speedify has responded to the issue with an updated version (15.4.1) that includes a complete rewrite of the flawed helper tool, eliminating the insecure handling of XPC messages and thereby closing this exploit vector. Users are strongly encouraged to update to the latest version to protect their devices from potential exploitation.

    "clean_text": "Question about shim and sbat policys in regards to vulnerability: CVE-2023-40547 Hello! I used to dualboot Ubuntu 24.02.4 LTS with Windows 11. Decided to completely remove Windows and was greeted with the ”Verifying shim SBAT data failed: Security Policy Violation”message. After disabling secureboot and reinstalling Ubuntu 24.02.2 LTS I was finally able to boot into linux again with secure boot enabled. Now to my question: As I understand it, Microsoft released an update to mitigate the Shim vulnerability tracked as: CVE-2023-40547 which caused many Linux distros using the vulnerable Shim version to get blocked in Shims own revocations list. I have checked my current Shim version which reports version 15.8, so far so good. (As I understand it, this is the latest version). However, I seem to still be using an old Shim revocations list. Command: mokutil —list-sbat-revocations gives me the following output: sbat,1,2023012900 shim,2 grub,3 grub.debian,4 However, Isn’t the new revocations list as follows: sbat,1,2024010900 shim,4 grub,3 grub.debian,4 How do I update the shim revocations list to the latest version? Should that not be included in the latest shim version by default?",

    "clean_text": "Gladinet Vulnerability Opening CenteStaack and Triofox. On April 3, 2025, Gladinet disclosed a vulnerability, CVE-2025-30406 (CVSS 9.8), impacting CentreStack and Triofox servers. The vulnerability is a deserialization vulnerability due to the CentreStack and Triofox portal's hardcoded machineKey use. The vulnerability impacts Gladinet CentreStack through version 16.1.10296.56315 and TrioFox below version 16.4.10317.56372. Is there active exploitation at the time of writing? At the time of writing (April 21, 2025), Blackpoint’s SOC has observed exploitation of this vulnerability against versions of CentreStack, including some that are fully patched. There is an even chance the patch for CVE-2025-30406 is failing to automatically rotate machineKey’s, which leaves these applications vulnerable. Exploitation of this deserialization vulnerability provides a threat actor remote code execution against the host running CentraStack or Triofox. Threat actors are leveraging this remote execution to enumerate the targeted host and Active Directory Environment. After enumeration, the Blackpoint SOC has observed threat actors that utilize access to remotely execute malicious payloads in memory amongst the following: * Read out /etc/hosts * Read out boot.ini * Read out configuration files * Enumerate domain computers, users, admins, trusts * Enumerate available shares * Enumerate current user and user’s role in domain * Enumerate network information * Enumerate running processes * Read out SAM Hive * Download and execute malicious stagers in memory The vulnerability has been reported to be actively exploited since at least March 2025; the vulnerability was added to the U.S. CISA’s Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog on April 08, 2025. Indicators observed: * portal.config * d27486c15c08cbd3ebe4de878995e4beae05f5f0824434a8bbf3a4c6362bf9a6 * 92.119.197\\[.\\]3 * c5ae011a.log.cdncache\\[.\\]rr\\[.\\]nu Recommendations * Immediate Action: Apply the latest CentreStack and Triofox server updates to ensure the vulnerability is patched; verify the machineKey was rotated. * If patching is not immediately available (or the patch did not rotate the machinekey), ensure to manually rotate the machineKey (Update machine Key). * Audit logs for indications of access, including logs for access to /portal/script endpoints. * Limit external access to CentreStack interfaces wherever possible. * Actively monitor for suspicious deserialization activities.",

The exploit didn’t require the user to do anything beyond opening what looked like a harmless file. This makes it particularly dangerous for less tech-savvy users and internal teams not trained in threat detection. What is known: \\- Affected all WhatsApp for Windows versions prior to 2.2450.6 \\- Exploited using specially crafted files with manipulated extensions \\- Meta confirmed active exploitation before the patch was issued It’s a reminder that even popular desktop apps can become threat vectors when spoofing and user trust intersect.

The first manufacturers, such as Asus and MSI, have already released the first BIOS update.The vulnerability CVE-2024-36347 aka ‘EntrySign’ allows attackers to bypass the microcode signature check so that they can gain access to rights at management level. Until now, it was assumed that this critical vulnerability only affected the older Zen iterations (Zen 1 to Zen 4). It has now been confirmed that Ryzen and Epyc CPUs based on Zen 5 are also affected, and AMD's latest security report shows that the current Epyc 9005 (‘Turin’) series server processors, the Ryzen 9000 (‘Granite Ridge’) and Ryzen 9000X3D (‘Granite Ridge-X’) series desktop CPUs and several mobile CPUs and APUs are also at risk from the vulnerability. The firmware update closes the vulnerability and mitigates the threat. * Support for faster memory Following the release of the latest firmware, MSI has also included a memory kit with 192 GiByte DDR5-6000 in its compatibility list for the first time, which is made up of a total of four 48 GiByte memory modules and therefore combines high capacity with high memory speed. In the coming days, all relevant motherboard manufacturers are expected to roll out corresponding BIOS updates with AMD AGESA Combo AM5PI v1.2.0.3c. and Threadripper/Epyc derivatives.",

    "clean_text": "Google Chrome Faces Critical Exploits from Use-After-Free Vulnerabilities Recent Use-After-Free vulnerabilities in Google Chrome have been actively exploited, posing a significant security risk to users. Key Points: - Multiple Use-After-Free vulnerabilities identified in Chrome's components. - Active exploitation allows attackers to bypass browser defenses and execute malicious code. - Google has implemented new protective mechanisms, but vulnerabilities remain. Google Chrome has encountered serious Use-After-Free (UAF) vulnerabilities that attackers are actively exploiting in the wild. These vulnerabilities arise from improper memory management, allowing potential malicious exploitation to lead to arbitrary code execution, data leakage, or denial of service. Recent CVEs such as CVE-2024-4671, CVE-2025-2476, and CVE-2025-2783 illustrate this escalating threat, with attackers using crafted HTML or malicious webpages to trick users into compromising their systems. The implications are severe, as compromised browsers can provide unauthorized access to sensitive user data and critical system resources. In response to these threats, Google has released urgent patches and introduced new security measures like MiraclePtr, which utilizes a smart-pointer-like strategy to prevent UAF exploitation. This approach incorporates a hidden reference counter that manages memory allocations more carefully, moving potentially dangerous areas to a quarantine space. However, it's important for users to be aware that not all components are completely safeguarded, underscoring the importance of keeping Chrome updated and practicing cautious web browsing habits. Organizations should prioritize monitoring their systems for outdated versions to mitigate risks associated with these persistent vulnerabilities.

    "clean_text": "New DslogdRAT Malware Targets Japan via Ivanti ICS Zero-Day Exploit Cybersecurity experts have identified DslogdRAT malware being distributed through a newly discovered zero-day vulnerability in Ivanti Connect Secure affecting organizations in Japan. Key Points: - CVE-2025-0282 is a critical vulnerability in Ivanti ICS that allowed for remote code execution. - DslogdRAT is being used alongside other malware in targeted espionage campaigns in Japan. - The exploitation of this flaw has led to a significant increase in malicious scanning activity against ICS appliances. Recently, cybersecurity researchers have raised alarms about the emergence of DslogdRAT malware, which is being deployed through a critical security flaw identified as CVE-2025-0282 in Ivanti Connect Secure. This vulnerability allowed unauthorized users to execute remote code, leading to the installation of malware and a Perl web shell within targeted systems, primarily affecting organizations in Japan in late 2024. The flaw was promptly addressed by Ivanti in January 2025, but the window of opportunity for attackers had already been exploited by cyber espionage groups, particularly a group known as UNC5337. DslogdRAT establishes communication with an external server, enabling it to send system information and execute arbitrary commands. This malware is part of a wider exploitation tactic, which has also seen other malware strains such as SPAWN being deployed. Reports indicate a surge in reconnaissance activities targeting Ivanti appliances, with suspicious scanning from over 1,000 unique IP addresses in the last 90 days, potentially indicating preparations for future attacks. The implications are severe as these attacks not only threaten the confidentiality of sensitive information but also pose a risk to the integrity of critical infrastructure in affected regions.

Anche se per il momento non si tratta ancora di un jailbreak completo.\\ Al momento, l’exploit permette di eseguire codice limitato sulla PlayStation 4, come script in Lua, un linguaggio di programmazione leggero.\\ Questo potrebbe aprire la porta a funzionalità come l’esecuzione di homebrew o, potenzialmente, l’avvio di giochi PS2 tramite emulatori. Tuttavia, non è ancora chiaro se l’exploit sia in grado di supportare l’esecuzione di backup di giochi PS4 in modo stabile.\\ Rispetto a exploit precedenti, questa vulnerabilità sembra promettente, ma non è priva di limitazioni. La tecnica basata sui salvataggi di gioco è stata utilizzata con successo su altre console, ma sulla PlayStation 4 non ha mai portato a un jailbreak completo.\\ Intanto gli sviluppatori stanno lavorando per capire se questa scoperta possa evolversi in una soluzione più avanzata.\\ A differenza di exploit precedenti, questa tecnica si basa su un errore di tipo double free nella funzione AIO del sistema operativo FreeBSD, che è alla base delle due console PlayStation 4 e PlayStation 5.\\ La vulnerabilità, correlata al CVE-2022-2390, riguarda i firmware della console PlayStation 4 dalla versione 5.0 fino alla 12.02, mentre è stata corretta nel firmware 12.50.\\ Per console PlayStation 5, l’exploit potrebbe funzionare fino alla versione 10.60, anche se non è ancora stato confermato con certezza se sia stato risolto nel firmware 11.0.\\ Un utente anonimo ha condiviso successivamente alcuni dump del kernel che hanno confermato la correzione della vulnerabilità nei firmware più recenti.\\ In seguito, il codice della patch è stato reso pubblico, e altri sviluppatori hanno confermato la validità della scoperta sui firmware precedenti.\\ \\ Stato attuale del jailbreak\\ Sulla PlayStation 4, i metodi attualmente disponibili includono:\\ \\ \\ Jailbreak 9.0, basato su exploit WebKit ed exFAT, richiede una chiavetta USB e funziona solo fino al firmware 9.0.\\ Exploit PPPwn, rilasciato nel 2023, supporta firmware fino alla verisione 11.0 ma necessita di un dispositivo esterno per inviare il payload.\\ \\ Questa nuova vulnerabilità potrebbe consentire un jailbreak completamente eseguibile via browser fino al firmware 9.60, eliminando la necessità di dispositivi esterni.\\ Per firmware superiori (fino a 12.02), potrebbe essere sfruttata tramite l’exploit Lua, che però richiede un raro gioco giapponese e un salvataggio modificato, rendendolo poco accessibile.\\ Sulla PlayStation 5, la situazione appare più frammentata:\\ \\ \\ L’exploit UMTX permette un jailbreak parziale fino al firmware 5.50 tramite browser, e fino al 7.61 utilizzando Blu-ray o Lua.\\ Se confermata, la nuova vulnerabilità potrebbe estendere il jailbreak fino al firmware 10.60, potenzialmente abbinabile ad altri exploit kernel già noti (come quello di TheFlow fino al 10.40). Tuttavia, l’assenza di un exploit hypervisor limita la possibilità di ottenere un jailbreak completo.\\ \\ Pare che la console PlayStation 4 possa beneficiare prima dei frutti di questa scoperta, grazie a una base più solida di exploit esistenti.\\ Sulla PlayStation 5 invece, la mancanza di un exploit dell'hypervisor e le possibili misure anti-Kstuff nei firmware più recenti rappresentano ostacoli significativi.\\ Fonte: x.comDiscover the best curtains shop in Dubai, where style meets quality and customization.

    "clean_text": "🔥 Top 10 Trending CVEs (26/04/2025) Here’s a quick breakdown of the 10 most interesting vulnerabilities trending today: 1. CVE-2025-43865 - React Router is a router for React. In versions on the 7.0 branch prior to version 7.5.2, its possible to modify pre-rendered data by adding a header to the request. This allows to completely spoof its contents and modify all the values of the data object passed to the HTML. This issue has been patched in version 7.5.2. - Published: 25/04/2025 - CVSS: 8.2 - Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H - Mentions: 4 - Priority: 2 - 2. CVE-2025-43707 - n/a - CVSS: 0 - Vector: n/a - Priority: n/a - 3. CVE-2025-27610 - Rack provides an interface for developing web applications in Ruby. Prior to versions 2.2.13, 3.0.14, and 3.1.12, Rack::Static can serve files under the specified root: even if urls: are provided, which may expose other files under the specified root: unexpectedly. The vulnerability occurs because Rack::Static does not properly sanitize user-supplied paths before serving files. Specifically, encoded path traversal sequences are not correctly validated, allowing attackers to access files outside the designated static file directory. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can gain access to all files under the specified root: directory, provided they are able to determine then path of the file. Versions 2.2.13, 3.0.14, and 3.1.12 contain a patch for the issue. Other mitigations include removing usage of Rack::Static, or ensuring that root: points at a directory path which only contains files which should be accessed publicly. It is likely that a CDN or similar static file server would also mitigate the issue. - Published: 10/03/2025 - CVSS: 7.5 - Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N - Mentions: 6 - Priority: 2 - 4. CVE-2024-10442 - Off-by-one error vulnerability in the transmission component in Synology Replication Service before 1.0.12-0066, 1.2.2-0353 and 1.3.0-0423 and Synology Unified Controller (DSMUC) before 3.1.4-23079 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code, potentially leading to a broader impact across the system via unspecified vectors. - Published: 19/03/2025 - CVSS: 10 - Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H - Mentions: 8 - Priority: 2 - 5. CVE-2025-32433 - Erlang/OTP is a set of libraries for the Erlang programming language. Prior to versions OTP-27.3.3, OTP-26.2.5.11, and OTP-25.3.2.20, a SSH server may allow an attacker to perform unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE). By exploiting a flaw in SSH protocol message handling, a malicious actor could gain unauthorized access to affected systems and execute arbitrary commands without valid credentials. This issue is patched in versions OTP-27.3.3, OTP-26.2.5.11, and OTP-25.3.2.20. A temporary workaround involves disabling the SSH server or to prevent access via firewall rules. - Published: 16/04/2025 - CVSS: 10 - Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H - Mentions: 44 - Priority: 2 - 6. CVE-2025-31324 - SAP NetWeaver Visual Composer Metadata Uploader is not protected with a proper authorization, allowing unauthenticated agent to upload potentially malicious executable binaries that could severely harm the host system. This could significantly affect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the targeted system. - Published: 24/04/2025 - CVSS: 10 - Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H - Mentions: 9 - Priority: 4 - 7. CVE-2025-34028 - A path traversal vulnerability in Commvault Command Center Innovation Release allows an unauthenticated actor to upload ZIP files, which, when expanded by the target server, result in Remote Code Execution. This issue affects Command Center Innovation Release: 11.38. - Published: 22/04/2025 - CVSS: 10 - Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:H - Mentions: 24 - Priority: 2 - 8. CVE-2025-43864 - React Router is a router for React. Starting in version 7.2.0 and prior to version 7.5.2, it is possible to force an application to switch to SPA mode by adding a header to the request. If the application uses SSR and is forced to switch to SPA, this causes an error that completely corrupts the page. If a cache system is in place, this allows the response containing the error to be cached, resulting in a cache poisoning that strongly impacts the availability of the application. This issue has been patched in version 7.5.2. - Published: 25/04/2025 - CVSS: 7.5 - Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H - Mentions: 1 - Priority: 2 - 9.

    "clean_text": "FINAL FIREWALL MIGRATION PLAN (HOPEFULLY) Hello All, TLDR at the bottom. This is the first time I've undertaken a firewall migration project like this so to say I'm experiencing nervousness/imposter syndrome would be an understatement (just a budding network admin that's looking at this as a right of passage). so any encouragement, feedback or hard truths are greatly appreciated. That said, in preparation for a firewall migration I've been working on manually building this firewall config for a while now in Eve-NG and so far everything is working the way it should (as far as I can tell). I think I'm just about done wrapping it up as we're nearing our deployment date so I wanted to see if there were any holes in my plan (please see attached diagram). As you can see in the diagram we're migrating 3 Cisco ASAs (a Guest, Corporate and \"Ad Hoc\" firewall) to a single 400 series Fortigate (we'll be making it an HA pair at a later date once we get a \"breakout switch\" and a 10G expansion module for our ASR). The main reason for the migration is to (1) upgrade speeds from 2G to 10G and (2) to modernize our equipment. After lots of research and thought I've decided to ditch the idea of VDOM/Virtual Interfaces and take the path of moving all of the interfaces from the ASAs to the Fortigate with the exception of the outside interfaces on the \"Guest\" and \"Ad Hoc\" firewalls (replaced by a single WAN interface). I'll also be using Central SNAT and rather than using IPSec as we did on the ASAs I'll be using SSL VPN due to time and my inability to get IPsec working right (before deploying we'll be updating to a recommended FortiOS version per CVE-2024-21762, CVE-2023-27997, and CVE-2022-42475 to fix SSL vulnerabilities. i.e. 7.2.11, 7.4.7, 7.6.2, etc). So my configuration pretty much involves copying/consolidating the following configs from the Cisco ASAs over to the Fortigate: * Interfaces: minus the two outside interfaces on the \"Guest\" and \"Ad Hoc\" firewalls * Zones: each interface gets it's own zone (for ease of moving ports later; also, I see no benefit to grouping interfaces for us) * Routing: each interface is a gateway except for two inside and one outside interface which are P2P and carry multiple subnets * SNAT/DNAT * Addresses/Groups, Services/Groups, IP Pools (only copying over what's specified in our firewall policies) * Firewall Policies: the only catch I had with this is the connection between the \"Ad Hoc\" firewall and the \"Corporate\" firewall as there were overlapping rules and the complication of \"Any\" rules. being that traffic to and from the \"Ad Hoc\" firewall basically has the potential to get filtered through 3 ACLs before getting out the door. * VPN: SSL VPN with a cert from a trusted CA on the outside and a cert from a local CA on the inside for LDAPS (MFA via MS) The only changes I think I'll have to make on other network devices are (1) moving the two 1Gb interface configs to a single 10Gb interface (2), rerouting public IPs pointed to the P2P outside interface of the \"Guest\" firewall to the main WAN interface and (3) configuring the 10Gb interfaces on our core switch for the firewall interfaces. I'm preparing for the likelihood that issues will arise (one issue that's been brought to my attention is to clear arp cache on up/downstream interfaces. my understanding is doing a shut/no shut should fix this). TLDR: * How bullet proof is my plan (I intend for this deployment to pretty much be plug and play)? * Given my situation how have you other network admins/engineers handled your first major project like this (and how did it turn out)? * How conservative should I be with logging/features (our model has close to a TB of storage)? * where would you recommend placing such features/logging (my understanding according to the security assessment notifications Fortigate gives me is that logging should be on for everything)? * What steps did you take during migration for deployment and assessment tests (should I only bring up one interface at a time and is there an order you would recommend)? I know I'm probably overthinking this and I also understand that not only is there no such thing as a \"one size fits all\" method but there's also no such thing as a perfectly secure network. The way I've gone about this configuration is due to management giving me a deadline that I think I've finally pushed to it's limit. So I just need to get everything up and functioning to the best of my ability without introducing new vulnerabilities (until I can modify the configs down the road). FYI our environment isn't mission critical/can afford downtime, only exposes VPN as well as a small handful of servers to the internet and we only have maybe 750 - 1000 devices between staff and guests connected at any given time. Thanks and cheers!",

    "clean_text": "Should I update my (very old) BIOS? Hi everyone! In early 2023 I built a PC from scratch by buying all the parts from Amazon/other sellers. My current setup is: - Gigabyte B650 Aorus Elite AX - Ryzen 5 7600 - AMD RX 6750XT - 2x 16 GB Corsair RAM 6000 MHz (don't remember CL, but shouldn't matter right now). The setup was smooth, everything is working fine. Let's say I'm good at following instructions. My only issue right now is that the PC takes a little bit to boot up, more than a minute. It's not a big deal, but feels like a lot more than it would take for a modern pc running SSD. Back then I read that it was due to the early bios build. Fast forward today, I somehow thought \"should I update the BIOS?\" I checked and it appears I have F1 version, released on 26/8/2022. That version is no longer even listed on the official Gigabyte download page. Should I update it? I'm not an expert, but I'm not even a complete newbie. Just to provide background I've got a MSc Degree in Computer Science Engineering and currently working in IT field. But I've never flashed a BIOS, I'm more a software guy than a hardware one, I've never worked on very low-level stuff. I've read online that the operation is recommended only if strictly required, but I've also read that it's an old thing and nowadays it's a safer operation. Also I've seen that the various BIOS versions cover at least three major security updates (Logofail, CVE-2024-36347, SMM Lock Bypass). And also implement a voltage limit on the CPU recommended by AMD. What would you do?",

    "clean_text": "Stolen 2019 MacBook Pro – Find My “Erase Pending” but thieves reinstalled Catalina and are on the desktop. How did they bypass Activation Lock & what data did they get? So here's the situation. My 2019 16-inch Intel MacBook Pro (T2 chip) and 2017 iPad Pro were stolen a few days ago from a cafe. As soon as I realized, I logged into iCloud and triggered both “Erase Device” and “Mark As Lost” via Find My — this was within 10 minutes of the theft. The devices showed up shortly after in a place in my city that’s notorious for being where all stolen electronics go — like a central market for used parts, stolen electronics, jailbroken devices, etc. Two days later, I managed to get someone with a “connection” inside that place to send me a photo of the Mac. And here’s the crazy part: it was booted up, on the macOS Catalina 10.15.7 desktop. They even sent me the About This Mac screen showing my exact serial number — no doubt it’s mine. But the OS is downgraded from Ventura 13.6.1 (what I was running) to Catalina. I can’t see the user folders or whether my desktop files are there — they only sent me the About screen — but no information in the desktop items. Meanwhile, Find My still shows the Mac as “Erase Pending”, which suggests it hasn’t gone online since the theft — or if it has, it’s on a filtered network. I’m not sure if I had FileVault enabled. I think not. (Yeah, I know.) No firmware or startup password either, but my only User (admin user) did have a 24 digit password. Find My was enabled, and I’ve always had 2FA on my Apple ID. So… how did they pull this off? What I think they did (please tell me if this sounds right or not) * Booted into Recovery Mode (Cmd + R). No password needed. * Opened Disk Utility and wiped the internal drive. * Reinstalled Catalina (either via Internet Recovery or a USB installer). * Never connected to Wi-Fi, or they blocked Apple activation servers (gdmf.apple.com, etc.). * During Setup Assistant, since there’s no connection, macOS never checks with Apple’s servers, so Activation Lock doesn’t kick in. * They create a new admin user and boot to the desktop. And now… they're just sitting on a Catalina machine, not sure if they managed to get online or not, but I would guess so, as they sell these stolen devices.* They’re known in that area for selling “unlocked” Macs, so I’m wondering if they did something more advanced — maybe some Activation Lock bypass or hardware trick? Questions I’m hoping someone here can help with: 1. Does this flow sound technically correct? Is it really this “easy” if FileVault was off and Recovery Mode isn’t locked down? 2. Is it likely they accessed my data before wiping? Could they have just reset the password via Recovery or deleted .AppleSetupDone to make a new admin and snoop around before erasing? 3. Are there real-world ways to actually kill Activation Lock on T2 Macs? Like logic board swaps, or any of those gray-market “checkm8-T2” tools? (I’ve read claims, but can’t tell what’s real.) 4. Anything else I should be doing now? I've left the device in iCloud with Erase Pending, and I've rotated every important password and token I can think of. Stuff I’ve been reading that might be relevant * The usual resetpassword trick in Recovery works fine if FileVault’s off. You can reset or create users with no Apple ID needed. * There was CVE-2025-24200 — a USB restricted mode bypass — but it doesn’t seem needed here since FileVault was off. * The old “reset NVRAM to disable Find My” trick doesn’t apply anymore — Apple patched that years ago (by Catalina). I’ve read rumors about checkm8-based tools unlocking T2 Macs, but haven’t seen credible confirmation that it works post-erase and* online. I’m trying to fully understand the actual limitations of Activation Lock and Find My in practice — especially when FileVault isn’t on. Apple implies “your data is safe,” but this sure feels like it’s not unless encryption is on too. Happy to answer anything that helps figure this out. I appreciate any insight — whether you've seen this before or have deeper technical knowledge about how Apple’s activation flow works. Thanks. TL;DR: My 2019 MacBook Pro (T2) was stolen. Find My shows \"Erase Pending\", but someone sent me a pic of it booted into Catalina, logged into a new user (my previous user/admin had a 24 digit password). How did they downgrade, erase, and get to the desktop without triggering Activation Lock? FileVault was likely off.

Meaning that if a device gets exploited elsewhere and then comes on to your network it can spread to other devices on that network.

    "clean_text": "🔥 Top 10 Trending CVEs (02/05/2025) Here’s a quick breakdown of the 10 most interesting vulnerabilities trending today: 1. CVE-2025-31191 - This issue was addressed through improved state management. This issue is fixed in macOS Ventura 13.7.5, tvOS 18.4, iOS 18.4 and iPadOS 18.4, macOS Sequoia 15.4, macOS Sonoma 14.7.5. An app may be able to access sensitive user data. - Published: 31/03/2025 - CVSS: 5.5 - Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N - Mentions: 5 - Priority: 4 - 2. CVE-2025-23244 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux contains a vulnerability which could allow an unprivileged attacker to escalate permissions. A successful exploit of this vulnerability might lead to code execution, denial of service, escalation of privileges, information disclosure, and data tampering. - Published: 01/05/2025 - CVSS: 7.8 - Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H - Mentions: 2 - Priority: 4 - 3. CVE-2025-29927 - Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications.

    "clean_text": "CISA Warns of KUNBUS Auth Bypass Vulnerabilities Exposes Systems to Remote Attacks CISA warns of critical auth bypass vulnerabilities in KUNBUS’s Revolution Pi industrial devices, risking remote attacks in sectors like manufacturing, energy, and healthcare. Key flaws include unauthenticated Node-RED access (CVE-2025-24522), path traversal bypass (CVE-2025-32011), and SSI injection (CVE-2025-24524). Patching, enabling strong auth, and network isolation are urgently recommended to prevent sabotage or downtime. CISA has issued an urgent advisory highlighting critical vulnerabilities in KUNBUS GmbH’s Revolution Pi industrial automation devices. These flaws, which include authentication bypass and remote code execution risks, threaten sectors like manufacturing, energy, and healthcare. Attackers can disrupt operations, manipulate safety systems, or cause widespread downtime. High-Severity Vulnerabilities in Revolution Pi The advisory identifies three primary vulnerabilities affecting Revolution Pi OS Bookworm (01/2025) and PiCtory software (versions 2.5.0–2.11.1): 1. Missing Authentication for Critical Function (CVE-2025-24522)The Node-RED server in Revolution Pi OS lacks default authentication, allowing unauthenticated attackers to executearbitrary commandson the operating system. With a CVSS v3.1 score of 10.0, this flaw poses the highest risk, enabling full remote control of industrial systems. 2. Authentication Bypass via Path Traversal (CVE-2025-32011)PiCtory’s authentication mechanism can be bypassed through path traversal, granting unauthorized access to critical functions (CVSS v3.1: 9.8). Attackers could reconfigure industrial processes or extract sensitive data. 3. Server-Side Includes (SSI) Injection (CVE-2025-24524)PiCtory’s failure to sanitize filenames allows authenticated attackers to inject malicious scripts, leading tocross-site scripting (XSS)attacks (CVSS v3.1: 9.8). This could compromise user sessions or deliver payloads to control systems. Affected Systems and Global Impact Revolution Pi devices are deployed worldwide in critical infrastructure sectors, including: KUNBUS, headquartered in Germany, has acknowledged the risks and released patches, but legacy deployments in highly regulated environments remain vulnerable due to slow update cycles. CISA and KUNBUSrecommendimmediate action to mitigate risks: KUNBUS plans to release a Cockpit plugin by April 2025 to simplify secure configurations. Adam Bromiley of Pen Test Partners discovered the vulnerabilities, which were collaboratively disclosed to CISA and KUNBUS. While no active exploitation has been reported, CISA emphasizes the urgency of patching, noting adversaries’ historical targeting of industrial systems for sabotage or extortion.",

      "Level 0: To stay safe, follow these rules and educate yourself about Tor and .onion urls: On DNM Safety: 1) Only use marketplaces listed on daunt, tor taxi, or dark fail. Anything else is a scam. 2) Dont use any sites listed on a \"HiddenWiki\" or some random shit you found on a search engine, a telegram channel, or website. You will be scammed. 3) Only order domestic to domestic. 4) Dont send your crypto directly from an exchange to a DNM deposit address. 5) Read the DNM bible. 6) NO DNMs operate on reddit nor have their own subs. Anything you find on reddit is a scammer. On educating yourself: 1) Read the /r/onions wiki here. 2) Read the /r/tor wiki here. 3) Read the /r/deepweb wiki here.
