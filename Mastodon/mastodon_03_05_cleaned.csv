"Alright folks, heads up!

Patch these ASAP! Seriously, don't delay, because leaving these unpatched basically rolls out the red carpet for attackers.

Like any secretion of secrets, Vaultwarden is a critical service that requires increased attention of security guards. Its compromise entails many risks. Since the secrets from other internal services are stored in Vaultwarden, when hacking, the attacking will recognize them. And if the product automatically receives secrets using the API, the attacker will fall on the host with extensive network connectedness. Therefore, our vulnerabilities study group analyzed Vaultwarden. As a result, we found two vulnerabilities of a high level of danger: CVE-2025-24364 and CVE-2025-24365.

"Whoa, heads up cybersecurity folks! There's a particularly nasty bug making the rounds: **CVE-2025-32433** in Erlang/OTP SSH. And yes, it scored a perfect CVSS 10.0 ü§Ø. We're talking potential **unauthorized remote code execution** here. Basically, an attacker can sneak SSH messages through *before* any authentication even happens. Think about that for a second. If your SSH daemon happens to be running as root... well, that's pretty much game over for the system. This isn't just a minor issue; it impacts *anyone* using the Erlang/OTP SSH implementation. **The good news?** Patches are available!

The CVE program, which is a global standard for identifying and tracking publicly disclosed gaps in software security, is used by companies such as Microsoft, Google, Apple, Intel or AMD. Lack of further financing may threaten its functioning. Mitre received funds for the CVE program from the US National Security Department and the Infrastructure Cyber ‚Äã‚Äãsecurity and security agency. Yosry Barsoum, vice president of Mitre, said that the organization remains involved in maintaining the program as a global resource, and the US government makes efforts to support its role. However, the expiry of the contract, which was the first to inform the letter leakage to members of the CVE board published on X and BlueSky platforms, raises concerns about the future of the program. And that we would be aware of the seriousness of the situation: CVE, i.e. Common Vulnerabilies and Exposures, is an international system for identifying, cataloging and public disclosure of gaps in software security and IT systems. Its purpose is to ensure a standard way to describe and track susceptibility, which enables companies, researchers and specialists in cyber security to quickly recognize threats, assess their seriousness and prioritize repair activities. The program is managed by Mitre Corporation, a non-profit organization, with financial support, among others, the US National Security Department. Each gap reported under the program receives a unique CVE identifier in the ""CVE-ROK-NUMER"" format, which allows it to be clearly identified in global databases. CVE records contain a description of vulnerability, its potential impact and, as far as possible, reference to corrections or remedies. The system is used by the largest technology companies such as Microsoft, Google, Apple, Intel and AMD, as well as government organizations and independent researchers. Do you understand what this database means due to lack of financing? The Cve program is about to go dark. Mitre just confirmed their funding to run cve and cwe expires tomorrow. That‚Äôs the main database the world relies on to track know vulnerabites in software. Yes, The Cve. The backbone of the entire vuln ecosystem. No cves = no shared ... pic.twitter.com/4bwcpxia1v - Feross April 15, 2025 Although Mitre ensures that Historical CVE records will remain available on the GitHub website, but this is also another suggestion that in the absence of new financing, new gaps may not be cataloged. Over 400 organizations such as Google, Apple and Microsoft are involved in the work on CVE, which play the role of CVE Numbering Authorities and issue CVE identifiers, which can partly alleviate the effects of lack of financing. Details of potential new sources of financing or impact on current program operations have not been given, but the situation is monitored by the cyber security community. It is very possible that this movement of the American administration is aimed at forcing financing the issue of cyber security by entities that should be most interested in the reliability of their own solutions, i.e. large, technological players. However, there is also a minus of this approach: selected companies may not be interested in publishing information on gaps in their own solutions, which in effect degrade global security. The existing gap base implemented as part of the CVE program was a benefit for users of IT solutions as well as for producers. Lack of financing the CVE program can disturb this order. One thing is certain: any disorders in cybersecurity infrastructure are delighted with cybercriminals. #Cve #cyber security #mitre #News #TRUMP"

It‚Äôs a tricky authentication bypass vulnerability. While that might sound a bit technical, the bottom line is it's seriously critical. Why? Because unauthenticated attackers could potentially log in as *any* user and basically hijack the entire system. Yikes. Now, CISA has flagged this one, adding it to their Known Exploited Vulnerabilities list. Their advice? Get patching done by April 28th! You know, this probably impacts quite a few places that might not even have it on their radar yet. üôÑ Why am I even posting about this? Well, because relying solely on automated scans often isn't enough ‚Äì they can miss things like this. This is exactly the kind of vulnerability that thorough pentesting is designed to uncover. Plus, let's be honest, your clients (or your own company!) will thank you big time for spotting and fixing these issues *before* things go boom. üòâ Here‚Äôs a quick action plan: *   Get those systems updated ASAP! *   Give your setups a thorough check. *   Time for a password reset on affected accounts. *   Make sure you've got 2FA turned on wherever possible. *   Keep a close watch on your network activity.

"# ESETresearch  has discovered a zero day exploit abusing  # CVE -2025-24983 vulnerability in the Windows kernel ü™ü to elevate privileges ( # LPE ). First seen in the wild in March 2023, the exploit was deployed through  # PipeMagic  backdoor on the compromised machines. The exploit targets Windows 8.1 and Server 2012 R2. The vulnerability affects OSes released before Windows 10 build 1809, including still supported Windows Server 2016. It does not affect more recent Windows OSes such as Windows 11. The vulnerability is a use after free in Win32k driver.

"I submitted a Pull Request to update MacPorts' OpenSSH to 9.9p2 here: https://github.com/macports/macports-ports/pull/27712 GitHub Continuous Integration checks are running. Hopefully they will be OK (Update 2 out of 3 have completed successfully, which is a good sign). I tested locally without issues, but I also build against LibreSSL locally, whereas GitHub CI and MacPorts' Build Bots I think default to OpenSSL. This release is to address some vulnerabilities identified by Qualys and other less critical bugs. More details from upstream here: https://www.openssh.com/releasenotes.html#9.9p2 Of particular note: "" Fix CVE-2025-26465 - ssh(1) in OpenSSH versions 6.8p1 to 9.9p1 (inclusive) contained a logic error that allowed an on-path attacker (a.k.a MITM) to impersonate any server when the VerifyHostKeyDNS option is enabled. This option is off by default. * Fix CVE-2025-26466 - sshd(8) in OpenSSH versions 9.5p1 to 9.9p1 (inclusive) is vulnerable to a memory/CPU denial-of-service related to the handling of SSH2 MSG PING packets. This condition may be mitigated using the existing PerSourcePenalties feature. Both vulnerabilities were discovered and demonstrated to be exploitable by the Qualys Security Advisory team. We thank them for their detailed review of OpenSSH."" If I read everything correctly, these vulnerabilities primarily only impact the Portable OpenSSH releases (which is what MacPorts uses). However, OpenBSD has also issued the following errata to mitigate one of the issues as it also appears to impact OpenBSD users: ""008: SECURITY FIX: February 18, 2025   All architectures sshd(8) denial of service relating to SSH2 MSG PING handling. ssh(1) server impersonation when VerifyHostKeyDNS enabled. A source code patch exists which remedies this problem."" Source code patch for OpenBSD here: https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/7.6/common/008_ssh.patch.sig Having written as much, it appears as if the main OpenSSH version for OpenBSD is still 9.9, so I am not going to make a submission for undeadly.org Other editors reading this are welcome to though, I just kind of have a lot of other stuff on my plate at present. As usual, I also have too much going on in my life to want more responsibilities such as commit access within MacPorts, so it's up to someone else to merge it. Update  #2 : I also decided to be a good Samaritan and reported the issue to Apple. Not that they have ever acknowledged my efforts for such things nor paid me from their bug bounty program in years of doing similar things. Because, OFC, Apple can't spare a penny to anyone like me. Maybe Qualys already reported it to them anyway (though they would have no obligation to do so, they did find the vulns and reported them upstream as would be expected). #OpenSSH   #MacPorts   #SecureShell   #InfoSec   #Cryptography   #Security   #CVE   #PatchTuesday   #OpenSource   #OpenBSD   #macOS",114026610301334686,2025-02-18T19:46:32.000Z,"['CVE-2025-26465', 'CVE-2025-26466']","I submitted a Pull Request to update MacPorts' OpenSSH to 9.9p2 here: GitHub Continuous Integration checks are running. Hopefully they will be OK . I tested locally without issues, but I also build against LibreSSL locally, whereas GitHub CI and MacPorts' Build Bots I think default to OpenSSL. This release is to address some vulnerabilities identified by Qualys and other less critical bugs. More details from upstream here: Of particular note: "" Fix CVE-2025-26465 - ssh in OpenSSH versions 6.8p1 to 9.9p1 contained a logic error that allowed an on-path attacker to impersonate any server when the VerifyHostKeyDNS option is enabled. This option is off by default. Fix CVE-2025-26466 - sshd in OpenSSH versions 9.5p1 to 9.9p1 is vulnerable to a memory/CPU denial-of-service related to the handling of SSH2 MSG PING packets. This condition may be mitigated using the existing PerSourcePenalties feature. Both vulnerabilities were discovered and demonstrated to be exploitable by the Qualys Security Advisory team. We thank them for their detailed review of OpenSSH."" If I read everything correctly, these vulnerabilities primarily only impact the Portable OpenSSH releases . However, OpenBSD has also issued the following errata to mitigate one of the issues as it also appears to impact OpenBSD users: ""008: SECURITY FIX: February 18, 2025 All architectures sshd denial of service relating to SSH2 MSG PING handling. ssh server impersonation when VerifyHostKeyDNS enabled. A source code patch exists which remedies this problem."" Source code patch for OpenBSD here: Having written as much, it appears as if the main OpenSSH version for OpenBSD is still 9.9, so I am not going to make a submission for undeadly.org Other editors reading this are welcome to though, I just kind of have a lot of other stuff on my plate at present. As usual, I also have too much going on in my life to want more responsibilities such as commit access within MacPorts, so it's up to someone else to merge it. Update #2 : I also decided to be a good Samaritan and reported the issue to Apple. Not that they have ever acknowledged my efforts for such things nor paid me from their bug bounty program in years of doing similar things. Because, OFC, Apple can't spare a penny to anyone like me. Maybe Qualys already reported it to them anyway . #OpenSSH #MacPorts #SecureShell #InfoSec #Cryptography #Security #CVE #PatchTuesday #OpenSource #OpenBSD #macOS"

"An impact summary has now been added to the openssl website: Impact summary: TLS and DTLS connections using raw public keys may be vulnerable to man-in-middle attacks when server authentication failure is not detected by clients. RPKs are disabled by default in both TLS clients and TLS servers. The issue only arises when TLS clients explicitly enable RPK use by the server, and the server, likewise, enables sending of an RPK instead of an X.509 certificate chain. The affected clients are those that then rely on the handshake to fail when the server‚Äôs RPK fails to match one of the expected public keys, by setting the verification mode to SSL_VERIFY_PEER. Clients that enable server-side raw public keys can still find out that raw public key verification failed by calling SSL_get_verify_result(), and those that do, and take appropriate action, are not affected. This issue was introduced in the initial implementation of RPK support in OpenSSL 3.2.

"# ESETresearch  discovered and reported to  @ certcc  a vulnerability that allows bypassing UEFI Secure Boot on most UEFI-based systems. This vulnerability,  # CVE -2024-7344, was found by  @ smolar_m  in a UEFI app signed by Microsoft‚Äôs 3rd-party UEFI certificate. The vulnerability is caused by the use of an unsafe PE/COFF-loading mechanism, lacking any Secure Boot-related checks, which allows loading arbitrary (even unsigned) UEFI applications. We reported our findings to CERT/CC in June 2024, who successfully contacted the affected vendors. The issue has now been fixed in these vendors‚Äô products and the old, vulnerable binaries were revoked by Microsoft in the January 14th Patch Tuesday update.

When the team and I are testing current vulnerabilities, the process looks like this: we set the vulnerable version of the software, check the performance of Proof of Concept, after which we are updated to the current version and convinced that the vulnerability is eliminated. Testing the relevant vulnerabilities in the monitoring system Nagios XI, I found that there is very little information on the vulnerabilities of the CVE-2024-24401 and CVE-2024-24402. In addition, it turned out that one of the vulnerabilities, namely, the vulnerability of the local increase in privileges of the CVE-2024-24402, was not completely crushed. https: // habr.com/ru/companies/pm/artic les/861122/ # Study of programs # Information Security # InformationSecurity # CVE # NAGIOSXI # RCE # LPE # SQLINJECTION # hacking"

It is an important part of the development process in many organizations. If an attacker gets access to the Jenkins server, this can lead to serious consequences, such as theft of accounting data, manipulations with code or even disruption of deployment processes. Access to Jenkins provides an attacker with the opportunity to intervene in a software conveyor, which can lead to chaos in the process of developing and compromising confidential data. In this article, we will consider the advisory conclusion on the vulnerability of the CVE-2024-43044, which is a vulnerability associated with arbitrary reading of files in Jenkins. We will show how to use this vulnerability to escalate privileges in order to achieve remote code execution on the jenkins controller when capturing the Jenkins agent. Jenkins architecture overview Jenkins is based on the ""Controller-Agents"" model, where the Jenkins controller is the main knot in the Jenkins installation. The controller manages Jenkins agents and coordinates their work, including planning tasks on agents and monitoring their condition. The interaction between the controller and agents can occur through the Inbound connection or SSH. https: // habr.com/ru/articles/850248/ # CVE # RCE # JENKINS"

"Critical Kibana Vulnerability - Arbitrary Code Execution via YAML Deserialization Date : September 5, 2024 CVE : CVE-2024-37285 Vulnerability Type : Deserialization of Untrusted Data CWE : [[CWE-502]] Sources :  Elastic Security Advisory Synopsis CVE-2024-37285 impacts Kibana versions 8.10.0 to 8.15.0, where a deserialization flaw allows remote code execution if an attacker injects malicious YAML payloads. This vulnerability requires that an attacker has elevated Elasticsearch and Kibana privileges. Issue Summary The vulnerability arises from improper YAML deserialization within Kibana. A malicious actor can craft a YAML payload and execute arbitrary code, provided they have specific Elasticsearch index and Kibana privileges. This issue affects Kibana from versions 8.10.0 through 8.15.0 and is critical due to its ease of exploitation and the potential for widespread impact. Technical Key Findings Attackers exploit this flaw by submitting a specially crafted YAML document that Kibana deserializes without proper validation. Once the malicious code is parsed, it can run on the server with elevated privileges, enabling arbitrary code execution.  The attacker must have the following Elasticsearch indices permissions;  write  access to system indices¬† .kibana_ingest* The¬† allow_restricted_indices ¬†flag needs to be set to¬† true The attacker must also have ANY of the following Kibana privileges;  Under¬† Fleet ¬†the¬† All ¬†privilege is granted Under¬† Integration ¬†the¬† Read ¬†or¬† All ¬†privilege is granted Access to the¬† fleet-setup ¬†privilege is gained through the Fleet Server‚Äôs service account token## Vulnerable Products Kibana versions 8.10.0 to 8.15.0. Impact Assessment Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands, leading to a complete system compromise. This could affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability, making it a high-risk issue for organizations relying on Kibana for data visualization and exploration. Patches or Workaround Upgrading to Kibana version 8.15.1 resolves this vulnerability. Additionally, limiting access to Elasticsearch indices and restricting Kibana privileges reduces exposure.

This vulnerability requires that an attacker has elevated Elasticsearch and Kibana privileges. Issue Summary The vulnerability arises from improper YAML deserialization within Kibana. A malicious actor can craft a YAML payload and execute arbitrary code, provided they have specific Elasticsearch index and Kibana privileges. This issue affects Kibana from versions 8.10.0 through 8.15.0 and is critical due to its ease of exploitation and the potential for widespread impact. Technical Key Findings Attackers exploit this flaw by submitting a specially crafted YAML document that Kibana deserializes without proper validation. Once the malicious code is parsed, it can run on the server with elevated privileges, enabling arbitrary code execution. The attacker must have the following Elasticsearch indices permissions; write access to system indices .kibanaingest The allowrestrictedindices flag needs to be set to true The attacker must also have ANY of the following Kibana privileges; Under Fleet the All privilege is granted Under Integration the Read or All privilege is granted Access to the fleet-setup privilege is gained through the Fleet Server‚Äôs service account token## Vulnerable Products Kibana versions 8.10.0 to 8.15.0. Impact Assessment Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands, leading to a complete system compromise. This could affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability, making it a high-risk issue for organizations relying on Kibana for data visualization and exploration. Patches or Workaround Upgrading to Kibana version 8.15.1 resolves this vulnerability. Additionally, limiting access to Elasticsearch indices and restricting Kibana privileges reduces exposure.
