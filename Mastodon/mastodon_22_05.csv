['CVE-2025-32433'],2025-04-18,mastodon,"Whoa, heads up cybersecurity folks! There's a particularly nasty bug making the rounds: **CVE-2025-32433** in Erlang/OTP SSH. And yes, it scored a perfect CVSS 10.0 🤯. We're talking potential **unauthorized remote code execution** here. Basically, an attacker can sneak SSH messages through *before* any authentication even happens. Think about that for a second. If your SSH daemon happens to be running as root... well, that's pretty much game over for the system. This isn't just a minor issue; it impacts *anyone* using the Erlang/OTP SSH implementation. **The good news?** Patches are available! You'll want to update to one of these versions ASAP: *   OTP-27.3.3 *   OTP-26.2.5.11 *   OTP-25.3.2.20 Speaking as a pentester, gotta say, that's a clever (and worrying!) vulnerability path . Another thing to keep in mind: your typical automated vulnerability scanners might completely miss this one due to the pre-auth nature. So, what's your take? Have any of you run into this yet or started testing for it? Curious to know what tools you're finding effective for detection or exploitation testing!

['CVE-2025-12345'],2025-04-16,mastodon,"Program CVE traci finansowanie – zagrożone globalne bezpieczeństwo cyfrowe MITRE Corporation, organizacja non-profit odpowiedzialna za program Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE), potwierdziła, że kontrakt na jego rozwój, obsługę i modernizację wygasa 16 kwietnia 2025 r. Tak, dziś. Program CVE, stanowiący globalny standard identyfikacji i śledzenia publicznie ujawnionych luk w zabezpieczeniach oprogramowania, jest wykorzystywany przez firmy takie jak Microsoft, Google, Apple, Intel czy AMD. Brak dalszego finansowania może zagrozić jego funkcjonowaniu. MITRE otrzymywało środki na program CVE od Departamentu Bezpieczeństwa Krajowego USA (DHS) oraz Agencji Cyberbezpieczeństwa i Bezpieczeństwa Infrastruktury (CISA). Yosry Barsoum, wiceprezes MITRE, oświadczył, że organizacja pozostaje zaangażowana w utrzymanie programu jako globalnego zasobu, a rząd USA podejmuje wysiłki, by wspierać jej rolę. Jednak wygaśnięcie kontraktu, o czym jako pierwszy informował wyciek listu do członków zarządu CVE opublikowany na platformach X i Bluesky, budzi obawy o przyszłość programu. I żebyśmy zdali sobie sprawę z powagi sytuacji: program CVE, czyli Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures, to międzynarodowy system służący do identyfikacji, katalogowania i publicznego ujawniania luk w zabezpieczeniach oprogramowania oraz systemów informatycznych. Jego celem jest zapewnienie standardowego sposobu opisywania i śledzenia podatności, co umożliwia firmom, badaczom i specjalistom ds. cyberbezpieczeństwa szybkie rozpoznawanie zagrożeń, ocenę ich powagi oraz priorytetyzację działań naprawczych. Program jest zarządzany przez MITRE Corporation, organizację non-profit, przy wsparciu finansowym, między innymi, Departamentu Bezpieczeństwa Krajowego USA (DHS). Każda luka zgłoszona w ramach programu otrzymuje unikalny identyfikator CVE w formacie „CVE-rok-numer” (np. CVE-2025-12345), co pozwala na jej jednoznaczną identyfikację w globalnych bazach danych. Rekordy CVE zawierają opis podatności, jej potencjalny wpływ oraz, w miarę możliwości, odniesienia do poprawek lub środków zaradczych. System jest wykorzystywany przez największe firmy technologiczne, takie jak Microsoft, Google, Apple, Intel czy AMD, a także organizacje rządowe i niezależnych badaczy. Czy rozumiecie co oznacza wyłączenie tej bazy (i jej regularnej aktualizacji) z powodu braku finansowania?    The CVE program is about to go dark. MITRE just confirmed their funding to run CVE and CWE expires tomorrow. That’s the main database the world relies on to track known vulnerabilities in software. Yes, the CVE. The backbone of the entire vuln ecosystem. No CVEs = no shared…  pic.twitter.com/4bwcPxiA1V — Feross (@feross)  April 15, 2025 Co prawda MITRE zapewnia, że historyczne rekordy CVE pozostaną dostępne na stronie GitHub, ale to stanowi jednocześnie kolejną sugestię, że w przypadku braku nowego finansowania nowe luki mogą nie być katalogowane. W prace nad CVE zaangażowanych jest ponad 400 organizacji, takich jak Google, Apple czy Microsoft, które pełnią rolę CVE Numbering Authorities (CNA) i wydają identyfikatory CVE, co może częściowo złagodzić skutki braku finansowania. Szczegóły dotyczące potencjalnych nowych źródeł finansowania lub wpływu na bieżące operacje programu nie zostały podane, ale sytuacja jest monitorowana przez społeczność cyberbezpieczeństwa. Bardzo możliwe, że ten ruch amerykańskiej administracji ma na celu wymuszenie finansowania kwestii cyberbezpieczeństwa przez podmioty, które powinny być najbardziej zainteresowane niezawodnością własnych rozwiązań, czyli dużych, technologicznych graczy. Jest jednak i minus takiego podejścia: wybrane firmy mogą nie być zainteresowane publikowaniem informacji na temat luk we własnych rozwiązaniach, co w efekcie degraduje globalne bezpieczeństwo. Dotychczasowa baza luk realizowana w ramach programu CVE stanowiła korzyść i dla użytkowników rozwiązań informatycznych, jak i dla producentów tychże. Brak finansowania programu CVE może zaburzyć ten porządek. Jedno jest pewne: jakiekolwiek zaburzenia w infrastrukturze cyberbezpieczeństwa uradują cyberprzestępców. #CVE   #cyberbezpieczeństwo   #MITRE   #news   #Trump"

We're looking at privilege escalation within CLFS. It seems the Storm-2460 threat actor group is getting in on the action, leveraging tools like PipeMagic, ultimately leading to RansomEXX deployment. Just great... *not*! This whole situation really hammers it home yet again: Patching isn't optional, folks – it's absolutely essential! The same goes for implementing the Principle of Least Privilege. It's also a good time to double-check your EDR settings and seriously ramp up your auditing game. And please, keep this in mind: running automated vulnerability scans is *not* the same as a proper penetration test! You need skilled people, actual human intelligence, digging into your systems to find what scanners miss. What have you all been seeing out there?

['CVE-2024-4040'],2025-04-08,mastodon,"Just another Monday in IT, right? Dealing with CrushFTP, the CISA KEV list, and active exploits... 🤯 So, let's talk about CVE-2024-4040 (heads-up, the original post might've had a typo on the year/number!). It’s a tricky authentication bypass vulnerability. While that might sound a bit technical, the bottom line is it's seriously critical. Why? Because unauthenticated attackers could potentially log in as *any* user and basically hijack the entire system. Yikes. Now, CISA has flagged this one, adding it to their Known Exploited Vulnerabilities list. Their advice? Get patching done by April 28th! You know, this probably impacts quite a few places that might not even have it on their radar yet.  Why am I even posting about this? Well, because relying solely on automated scans often isn't enough – they can miss things like this. This is exactly the kind of vulnerability that thorough pentesting is designed to uncover. Plus, let's be honest, your clients (or your own company!) will thank you big time for spotting and fixing these issues *before* things go boom.  Here’s a quick action plan: *   Get those systems updated ASAP! *   Give your setups a thorough check. *   Time for a password reset on affected accounts. *   Make sure you've got 2FA turned on wherever possible. *   Keep a close watch on your network activity. Over to you: What are your go-to tools for hunting down vulnerabilities like this one? Drop your thoughts below! 🤔 # infosec   # pentesting   # CISA   # cybersecurity   # CrushFTP   # CVE"

['CVE-2024-56161'],2025-02-07,mastodon,"У тех же VLIW-процессоров типа «Эльбрус» нет загружаемого микрокода, а потому и неожиданностей гораздо меньше (для эксплуатирующих организаций). Вот множество примеров того, что именно прячется в некорректной работе с микрокодом. Это только самые громкие и за последние пару лет.   Исследователи безопасности из компании Google опубликовали информацию об уязвимости (CVE-2024-56161) в процессорах AMD, затрагивающей загрузчик микрокода и позволяющей обойти механизм проверки цифровой подписи при обновлении микрокода. Загрузка модифицированного микрокода позволяет скомпрометировать механизм AMD  #SEV  (Secure Encrypted Virtualization), применяемый в системах виртуализации для защиты виртуальных машин от вмешательства со стороны гипервизора или администратора хост-системы. Уязвимость вызвана использованием небезопасной хэш-функции в коде, выполняющем проверку цифровой подписи после загрузки микрокода в CPU. Для совершения атаки необходимо наличие прав администратора в локальной системе (возможности выполнить код на уровне нулевого кольца защиты  #ring0 , находясь не в виртуальной машине). В ходе атаки можно вклиниться в работу гостевых систем, защищённых при помощи расширений AMD SEV (Secure Encrypted Virtualization) и SEV-SNP (Secure Nested Paging), предоставляющих гарантии целостности памяти виртуальных машин, изолирующих процессорные регистры и обеспечивающих безопасную работу со вложенными таблицами страниц памяти. Механизм AMD SEV создавался для того, чтобы персонал датацентров и облачных провайдеров не мог изменить или проанализировать содержимое памяти защищённых гостевых систем, а также исказить вычисления. Исследователями подготовлен прототип эксплоита, позволяющий загрузить в CPU произвольный микрокод, не заверенный цифровой подписью. Для демонстрации опасности уязвимости предложено обновление микрокода, меняющее логику работы инструкции  #RDRAND , применяемой в качестве одного из источников энтропии в генераторах псевдослучайных чисел, используемых в процессе формирования ключей, при выполнении криптографических операций и для генерации случайных идентификаторов. Изменение приводит к возвращению инструкцией RDRAND только числа 4, вместо случайной последовательности. Для предотвращения совершения реальных атак на системы конфиденциальных вычислений изменённый микрокод обнуляет флаг CF (carry flag), т.е. помечает выдаваемое значение ошибочным. Дополнительные детали и инструменты для генерации изменённого микрокода планируют опубликовать 5 марта, чтобы дать пользователям время на установку исправления на своих системах. Успешный пример атаки продемонстрирован для серверов с процессорами AMD  #EPYC  7B13  #Milan  и AMD Ryzen 9 7940HS  #Phoenix . В отчёте компании AMD указано, что уязвимость проявляется в процессорах AMD на базе 1-4 поколений микроархитектуры Zen. Обновление микрокода с устранением уязвимости было выпущено 13 декабря 2024 года для процессоров серий AMD EPYC 7001, 7002 и 7003 (#Naples,  #Rome ,  #Milan  и  #Milan -X), а 16 декабря для процессоров серии AMD EPYC 9004 (#Genoa,  #Genoa -X и  #Bergamo /#Siena). Для устранения уязвимости на системах, в которых используется аттестация  #SEV -SNP, дополнительно требуется обновление прошивки AMD SEV (поставляется вместе с обновлениями BIOS от производителей оборудования).   Дополнительно сообщается об ещё одной уязвимости в процессорах AMD, допускающей проведение атаки по сторонним каналам для извлечения информации о вычислениях в гостевых системах, защищённых с использованием механизма AMD SEV. Проблема затрагивает 1-4 поколения процессов AMD EPYC и связана с возможностью извлечения из процессорного кэша данных, оседающих в процессе работы защищённых гостевых систем. Для анализа содержимого кэша может использоваться метод Prime+Probe, подразумевающий заполнение кэша эталонным набором значений и определение изменений через измерение времени доступа к ним при повторном заполнении.    В  #Linux  обнаружен механизм обхода  защиты от уязвимости  #Spectre  на процессорах  #Intel  и  #AMD Новой уязвимости подвержены потребительские процессоры Intel Core 12, 13 и 14 поколений, серверные  #Xeon  5 и 6 поколений, а также чипы AMD  #Zen  1, Zen 1+ и Zen 2 Обнаруженная исследователями Швейцарской высшей технической школы Цюриха (ETH Zurich) схема атаки позволяют обойти защитный механизм  #IBPB  (Indirect Branch Predictor Barrier), не позволяющий злоупотреблять спекулятивным выполнением Швейцарские учёные подтвердили возможность перехватывать результаты спекулятивного выполнения даже после срабатывания механизма IBPB, то есть с обходом существующих средств защиты и с утечкой конфиденциальной информации — в частности, это может быть извлечённый из процесса suid хэш пароля root В случае процессоров Intel механизм IBPB не в полной мере устраняет результат выполнения недействительной функции после смены контекста У процессоров AMD метод IBPB-on-entry в ядре  #Linux  срабатывает неправильно, из-за чего результаты работы устаревших функций не удаляются после  #IBPB О своём открытии исследователи сообщили  #Intel  и  #AMD  в июне 2024 года В Intel ответили, что к тому моменту проблема уже была обнаружена силами самой компании — соответствующей уязвимости присвоили номер  #CVE -2023-38575 Ещё в марте Intel выпустила обновление микрокода, но, как установили исследователи, это не помогло исправить ошибку во всех операционных системах, включая Ubuntu В AMD также подтвердили факт наличия уязвимости и заявили, что она уже была задокументирована и зарегистрирована под номером CVE-2022-23824 При этом производитель включил в список уязвимых архитектуру Zen 3, которую швейцарские учёные в своей работе не отметили В AMD ошибку охарактеризовали как программную, а не аппаратную; учитывая, что производитель знает о ней давно, и она затрагивает только старые микроархитектуры, в компании приняли решение не выпускать закрывающее уязвимость обновление микрокода Таким образом, оба производителя знали о механизме обхода уязвимости, но в документации они отметили его как потенциальный Швейцарские учёные, однако, продемонстрировали, что атака срабатывает на Linux 6.5 с защитой IBPB-on-entry, которая считается наиболее эффективной против эксплойтов типа  #Spectre И поскольку AMD отказалась закрывать её, исследователи связались с разработчиками ядра Linux с намерением самостоятельно разработать патч для «красных» процессоров   Процессоры компании AMD на архитектурах Zen 2 и Zen 3 оказались уязвимы к атаке  #faulTPM , позволяющей взломать их через модуль  #TPM , пишут порталы Tom’s Hardware и TechSpot. Ирония здесь в том, что  #TPM  сам по себе отвечает за безопасность – это доверенный платформенный модуль. Уязвимость процессоров AMD на перечисленных архитектурах нельзя устранить – можно лишь отказаться от их переключиться на решения Intel – ее  #CPU  в неспособности противостоять атаке  #faulTPM  пока не уличили. Проблему в чипах AMD выявили специалисты по кибербезопасности из Берлинского технического университета. В их отчете говорится о результатах тестирования процессоров  #Ryzen  на Zen 2 и Zen 3 – очень востребованных в России и мире. Первое поколение Ryzen с первой же версией архитектуры Zen в документе не упоминается – видимо, эти CPU в тестах не участвовали, так как к маю 2023 г. они давно морально устарели.

['CVE-2022-23824'],2025-02-07,mastodon,"У тех же VLIW-процессоров типа «Эльбрус» нет загружаемого микрокода, а потому и неожиданностей гораздо меньше (для эксплуатирующих организаций). Вот множество примеров того, что именно прячется в некорректной работе с микрокодом. Это только самые громкие и за последние пару лет.   Исследователи безопасности из компании Google опубликовали информацию об уязвимости (CVE-2024-56161) в процессорах AMD, затрагивающей загрузчик микрокода и позволяющей обойти механизм проверки цифровой подписи при обновлении микрокода. Загрузка модифицированного микрокода позволяет скомпрометировать механизм AMD  #SEV  (Secure Encrypted Virtualization), применяемый в системах виртуализации для защиты виртуальных машин от вмешательства со стороны гипервизора или администратора хост-системы. Уязвимость вызвана использованием небезопасной хэш-функции в коде, выполняющем проверку цифровой подписи после загрузки микрокода в CPU. Для совершения атаки необходимо наличие прав администратора в локальной системе (возможности выполнить код на уровне нулевого кольца защиты  #ring0 , находясь не в виртуальной машине). В ходе атаки можно вклиниться в работу гостевых систем, защищённых при помощи расширений AMD SEV (Secure Encrypted Virtualization) и SEV-SNP (Secure Nested Paging), предоставляющих гарантии целостности памяти виртуальных машин, изолирующих процессорные регистры и обеспечивающих безопасную работу со вложенными таблицами страниц памяти. Механизм AMD SEV создавался для того, чтобы персонал датацентров и облачных провайдеров не мог изменить или проанализировать содержимое памяти защищённых гостевых систем, а также исказить вычисления. Исследователями подготовлен прототип эксплоита, позволяющий загрузить в CPU произвольный микрокод, не заверенный цифровой подписью. Для демонстрации опасности уязвимости предложено обновление микрокода, меняющее логику работы инструкции  #RDRAND , применяемой в качестве одного из источников энтропии в генераторах псевдослучайных чисел, используемых в процессе формирования ключей, при выполнении криптографических операций и для генерации случайных идентификаторов. Изменение приводит к возвращению инструкцией RDRAND только числа 4, вместо случайной последовательности. Для предотвращения совершения реальных атак на системы конфиденциальных вычислений изменённый микрокод обнуляет флаг CF (carry flag), т.е. помечает выдаваемое значение ошибочным. Дополнительные детали и инструменты для генерации изменённого микрокода планируют опубликовать 5 марта, чтобы дать пользователям время на установку исправления на своих системах. Успешный пример атаки продемонстрирован для серверов с процессорами AMD  #EPYC  7B13  #Milan  и AMD Ryzen 9 7940HS  #Phoenix . В отчёте компании AMD указано, что уязвимость проявляется в процессорах AMD на базе 1-4 поколений микроархитектуры Zen. Обновление микрокода с устранением уязвимости было выпущено 13 декабря 2024 года для процессоров серий AMD EPYC 7001, 7002 и 7003 (#Naples,  #Rome ,  #Milan  и  #Milan -X), а 16 декабря для процессоров серии AMD EPYC 9004 (#Genoa,  #Genoa -X и  #Bergamo /#Siena). Для устранения уязвимости на системах, в которых используется аттестация  #SEV -SNP, дополнительно требуется обновление прошивки AMD SEV (поставляется вместе с обновлениями BIOS от производителей оборудования).   Дополнительно сообщается об ещё одной уязвимости в процессорах AMD, допускающей проведение атаки по сторонним каналам для извлечения информации о вычислениях в гостевых системах, защищённых с использованием механизма AMD SEV. Проблема затрагивает 1-4 поколения процессов AMD EPYC и связана с возможностью извлечения из процессорного кэша данных, оседающих в процессе работы защищённых гостевых систем. Для анализа содержимого кэша может использоваться метод Prime+Probe, подразумевающий заполнение кэша эталонным набором значений и определение изменений через измерение времени доступа к ним при повторном заполнении.    В  #Linux  обнаружен механизм обхода  защиты от уязвимости  #Spectre  на процессорах  #Intel  и  #AMD Новой уязвимости подвержены потребительские процессоры Intel Core 12, 13 и 14 поколений, серверные  #Xeon  5 и 6 поколений, а также чипы AMD  #Zen  1, Zen 1+ и Zen 2 Обнаруженная исследователями Швейцарской высшей технической школы Цюриха (ETH Zurich) схема атаки позволяют обойти защитный механизм  #IBPB  (Indirect Branch Predictor Barrier), не позволяющий злоупотреблять спекулятивным выполнением Швейцарские учёные подтвердили возможность перехватывать результаты спекулятивного выполнения даже после срабатывания механизма IBPB, то есть с обходом существующих средств защиты и с утечкой конфиденциальной информации — в частности, это может быть извлечённый из процесса suid хэш пароля root В случае процессоров Intel механизм IBPB не в полной мере устраняет результат выполнения недействительной функции после смены контекста У процессоров AMD метод IBPB-on-entry в ядре  #Linux  срабатывает неправильно, из-за чего результаты работы устаревших функций не удаляются после  #IBPB О своём открытии исследователи сообщили  #Intel  и  #AMD  в июне 2024 года В Intel ответили, что к тому моменту проблема уже была обнаружена силами самой компании — соответствующей уязвимости присвоили номер  #CVE -2023-38575 Ещё в марте Intel выпустила обновление микрокода, но, как установили исследователи, это не помогло исправить ошибку во всех операционных системах, включая Ubuntu В AMD также подтвердили факт наличия уязвимости и заявили, что она уже была задокументирована и зарегистрирована под номером CVE-2022-23824 При этом производитель включил в список уязвимых архитектуру Zen 3, которую швейцарские учёные в своей работе не отметили В AMD ошибку охарактеризовали как программную, а не аппаратную; учитывая, что производитель знает о ней давно, и она затрагивает только старые микроархитектуры, в компании приняли решение не выпускать закрывающее уязвимость обновление микрокода Таким образом, оба производителя знали о механизме обхода уязвимости, но в документации они отметили его как потенциальный Швейцарские учёные, однако, продемонстрировали, что атака срабатывает на Linux 6.5 с защитой IBPB-on-entry, которая считается наиболее эффективной против эксплойтов типа  #Spectre И поскольку AMD отказалась закрывать её, исследователи связались с разработчиками ядра Linux с намерением самостоятельно разработать патч для «красных» процессоров   Процессоры компании AMD на архитектурах Zen 2 и Zen 3 оказались уязвимы к атаке  #faulTPM , позволяющей взломать их через модуль  #TPM , пишут порталы Tom’s Hardware и TechSpot. Ирония здесь в том, что  #TPM  сам по себе отвечает за безопасность – это доверенный платформенный модуль. Уязвимость процессоров AMD на перечисленных архитектурах нельзя устранить – можно лишь отказаться от их переключиться на решения Intel – ее  #CPU  в неспособности противостоять атаке  #faulTPM  пока не уличили. Проблему в чипах AMD выявили специалисты по кибербезопасности из Берлинского технического университета. В их отчете говорится о результатах тестирования процессоров  #Ryzen  на Zen 2 и Zen 3 – очень востребованных в России и мире. Первое поколение Ryzen с первой же версией архитектуры Zen в документе не упоминается – видимо, эти CPU в тестах не участвовали, так как к маю 2023 г. они давно морально устарели. С момента их выхода прошло шесть лет. Вломиться в чип AMD они смогли через встроенный в него сопроцессор безопасности  #PSP .

This vulnerability requires that an attacker has elevated Elasticsearch and Kibana privileges. Issue Summary The vulnerability arises from improper YAML deserialization within Kibana. A malicious actor can craft a YAML payload and execute arbitrary code, provided they have specific Elasticsearch index and Kibana privileges. This issue affects Kibana from versions 8.10.0 through 8.15.0 and is critical due to its ease of exploitation and the potential for widespread impact. Technical Key Findings Attackers exploit this flaw by submitting a specially crafted YAML document that Kibana deserializes without proper validation. Once the malicious code is parsed, it can run on the server with elevated privileges, enabling arbitrary code execution.  The attacker must have the following Elasticsearch indices permissions;  write  access to system indices  .kibana_ingest* The  allow_restricted_indices  flag needs to be set to  true The attacker must also have ANY of the following Kibana privileges;  Under  Fleet  the  All  privilege is granted Under  Integration  the  Read  or  All  privilege is granted Access to the  fleet-setup  privilege is gained through the Fleet Server’s service account token## Vulnerable Products Kibana versions 8.10.0 to 8.15.0. Impact Assessment Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands, leading to a complete system compromise. This could affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability, making it a high-risk issue for organizations relying on Kibana for data visualization and exploration. Patches or Workaround Upgrading to Kibana version 8.15.1 resolves this vulnerability. Additionally, limiting access to Elasticsearch indices and restricting Kibana privileges reduces exposure.

The issue has now been fixed in these vendors’ products and the old, vulnerable binaries were revoked by Microsoft in the January 14th Patch Tuesday update. Instructions to check whether you’re affected by this vulnerability and to verify that the necessary revocations have been installed on your system can be found in our blogpost:  https://www. welivesecurity.com/en/eset-res earch/under-cloak-uefi-secure-boot-introducing-cve-2024-7344/"
